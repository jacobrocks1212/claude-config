# Completion Receipt

Fix shipped in commit(s):
- b9d335ad — harden(script): residue guard scans template pre-injection, not bound prompt

Verified present in the current tree by the 2026-07-18 bug-backlog audit (read-only
verification agents confirmed the SPEC's named fix sites in current code; a commit-message
claim alone was not accepted as evidence).

Receipt + archive performed OUT-OF-PIPELINE per the docs/bugs/CLAUDE.md reconciliation
contract ("Fixing a bug OUT-OF-PIPELINE"): the fix landed via harden rounds / feature work
that never ran the __mark_fixed__ -> --archive-fixed tail, leaving a Concluded SPEC with a
shipped fix.
