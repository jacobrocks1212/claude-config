# Completion Receipt

Fix shipped in commit(s):
- c8a05bf7 — harden(skill-prose): deterministic terminal for coherence-recovery honest-stuck loop + canonical verification-only marker in spec-phases/write-plan producers

Verified present in the current tree by the 2026-07-18 bug-backlog audit (read-only
verification agents confirmed the SPEC's named fix sites in current code; a commit-message
claim alone was not accepted as evidence).

Receipt + archive performed OUT-OF-PIPELINE per the docs/bugs/CLAUDE.md reconciliation
contract ("Fixing a bug OUT-OF-PIPELINE"): the fix landed via harden rounds / feature work
that never ran the __mark_fixed__ -> --archive-fixed tail, leaving a Concluded SPEC with a
shipped fix.
