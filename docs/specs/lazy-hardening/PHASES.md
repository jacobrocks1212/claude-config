## Phase 1 — Test safety net (zero behavior change)

**Goal:** Byte-pinned `--test` baseline + missing fixtures for `bug-state.py` before any
behavior changes land.

**Entry criteria:** None — first phase.

**Deliverables:**
- [x] `user/scripts/tests/baselines/bug-state-test-baseline.txt` + durable matching test
- [x] Cloud-mode fixtures (currently zero `cloud=True` coverage)
- [x] Device re-open fixture (`STEP_DEVICE_REOPEN`)
- [x] Step-9 `SKIP_MCP_TEST.md` / `MCP_TEST_RESULTS.md` fixtures
- [x] `backfill_receipts` fixture; severity-ordering fixture (multiple unlisted bugs)
- [x] Stale harness docstrings cleaned (both scripts)
- [x] AlgoBooth `--repo-root` JSON baseline for bug-state.py

**Runtime Verification:**
- [x] `python3 ~/.claude/scripts/lazy-state.py --test` exits 0
- [x] `python3 ~/.claude/scripts/bug-state.py --test` exits 0 and matches baseline
- [x] `python3 ~/.claude/scripts/test_lazy_core.py` exits 0

**Implementation Notes:**

#### Implementation Notes (Phase 1 — Batch 1: WU-1, WU-2)
**Completed:** 2026-06-10
**Review verdict:** PASS (independent Opus reviewer; ground-truth verified clean, zero-drift byte-identical both scripts)
**Work completed:**
- WU-1 (`bug-state-test-baseline.txt` + durable matching test): bug-state.py already had a `--test`/`run_smoke_tests` mode (the plan's "add/confirm" — confirmed present). Added `test_bug_state_test_output_matches_baseline` to `test_lazy_core.py` and captured the golden baseline. bug-state `--test` output is naturally platform-neutral (no temp paths emitted).
- WU-1 (folded-in preexisting defect): the existing `test_lazy_state_test_output_matches_baseline` was RED on this Windows host — the committed baseline was Linux-captured + stale (missing newer fixtures), and the normalization only handled the random tempdir suffix, not the OS temp-root prefix or `\`-vs-`/` separators. Added a shared `_normalize_smoke_output()` helper (3-step, idempotent, canonicalizes suffix + temp-root → `<TMP>/` + separators), refactored the lazy-state test to use it, regenerated `lazy-state-test-baseline.txt` in canonical form, and added `test_normalize_smoke_output_is_platform_neutral` (proves Windows/POSIX forms canonicalize identically — cross-platform is now a TESTED contract, not a design claim).
- WU-2 (`bug-state-algobooth.json`): captured the `bug-state.py --repo-root <AlgoBooth>` reference snapshot + README section. Per the lazy-state-algobooth.json precedent (README: drift-tolerant same-session reference, deliberately NOT value-asserted), the durable test `test_bug_state_algobooth_baseline_wellformed` asserts only structural well-formedness (parses + 6 core keys), and the byte-identical *value* check is the orchestrator's phase-time zero-drift probe — not a rotting pytest. This reconciles the plan's "a test asserting current output matches it" against the precedent it told us to mirror.
**Integration notes:**
- `_normalize_smoke_output` is the shared canonicalizer for BOTH scripts' baselines — WU-3 (Batch 2) regenerates `bug-state-test-baseline.txt` through it after adding fixtures.
- Full suite is 82/82; the 3 new tests are registered in `_TESTS` (lines ~1480/1482/1484).
- Zero-behavior-change confirmed: `lazy-state.py`/`bug-state.py` unmodified in the working tree; `--repo-root` output byte-identical to phase-start for both.
**Pitfalls & guidance:**
- The lazy-state baseline can only be regenerated correctly by piping live `--test` output through `_normalize_smoke_output` (never hand-edit) — otherwise byte-identity breaks subtly on the temp-path line.
- Two new test docstrings still carry stale "intentionally RED until baseline created" narrative (now GREEN). Deferred to WU-4 (Batch 3 — "stale harness docstrings cleaned") rather than an extra dispatch.
**Files modified:**
- `user/scripts/test_lazy_core.py` — `_normalize_smoke_output` helper + lazy-state test refactor + 3 new tests + registry entries
- `user/scripts/tests/baselines/lazy-state-test-baseline.txt` — regenerated (canonical, platform-neutral)
- `user/scripts/tests/baselines/bug-state-test-baseline.txt` — new golden capture
- `user/scripts/tests/baselines/bug-state-algobooth.json` — new reference snapshot
- `user/scripts/tests/baselines/README.md` — new `bug-state-algobooth.json` section

#### Implementation Notes (Phase 1 — Batch 2: WU-3)
**Completed:** 2026-06-10
**Review verdict:** PASS (independent Opus reviewer; each fixture's tree→branch→assertion traced; additive-only below banner; baseline byte-identical + deterministic + date-free)
**Work completed:**
- Added 7 smoke fixtures to `bug-state.py`'s SMOKE FIXTURES section (below the line-853 test-agent banner), covering all 4 PHASES checkboxes: `cloud-defer-mcp` + `cloud-skip-mcp` (first-ever `cloud=True` coverage → `STEP_CLOUD_DEFER_MCP`/`__write_deferred_non_cloud__` and `STEP_MCP_SKIP`/`__write_validated_from_skip__`); `device-reopen` (`STEP_DEVICE_REOPEN`/`mcp-test`, real-device twin of the no-device `device-deferred` fixture); `step9-skip-mcp` + `step9-mcp-results` (workstation Step-9 sentinel paths → skip and `Step 9b: write validated`/`__write_validated_from_results__`); `severity-ordering` (unlisted on-disk P0 picked before P2 by `_SEVERITY_RANK`); `backfill-receipts-direct` (bespoke block: Fixed-without-FIXED.md backfilled, Won't-fix exempt).
- Regenerated `bug-state-test-baseline.txt` through `_normalize_smoke_output` to absorb the 7 new PASS lines.
**Integration notes:**
- These fixtures characterize CURRENT `compute_state` behavior. Phase 2's cloud Step-9 hard-halt / receipt-content-validation changes WILL legitimately shift `cloud-defer-mcp` and the receipt fixtures — that is the intended early-warning (regenerate the baseline as part of those phases).
- RED→GREEN was demonstrated for `cloud-defer-mcp` and `device-reopen` (deliberately-wrong expectation → captured FAIL → corrected to GREEN).
- `severity-ordering` is deliberately constructed so the higher-severity bug has the LATER Discovered date — a date-only (severity-blind) sort would flip the result, so the test is non-tautological.
**Pitfalls & guidance:**
- `backfill_receipts` uses `datetime.now()`; the fixture asserts only the return dict + FIXED.md existence and prints no date, so the baseline does not rot daily.
- Zero behavior change verified: diff is purely additive (+343/-0), all hunks below the line-853 banner; `--repo-root` zero-drift probe byte-identical to phase-start for both scripts.
**Files modified:**
- `user/scripts/bug-state.py` — 7 new smoke fixtures (SMOKE FIXTURES section only)
- `user/scripts/tests/baselines/bug-state-test-baseline.txt` — regenerated

#### Implementation Notes (Phase 1 — Batch 3: WU-4 + Post-Phase)
**Completed:** 2026-06-10
**Review verdict:** PASS (inline review — comment/docstring-only diff fully visible + mechanically verified; zero-drift byte-identical both scripts; baselines still match; suite 82/82)
**Work completed:**
- WU-4 (stale harness docstrings cleaned, both scripts): rewrote the `run_smoke_tests()` docstring in `bug-state.py` (dropped the "compute_state() is a stub / expected RED state for WU-2.1" narrative — compute_state is fully implemented) and updated 4 stale `#` comments there + 2 in `lazy-state.py` (scope_feature_id "does not exist yet" / "RED") to describe the now-implemented state and label the surviving `except NotImplementedError`/`except TypeError` clauses as dead defensive guards. Also cleaned the 2 deferred Batch-1 test docstrings + their inline read-comments in `test_lazy_core.py` ("intentionally RED until baseline created" → GREEN steady-state contract).
- **Comment/docstring-only**: every changed line is a `#` comment or `"""docstring"""`; NO executable line, printed string literal (the `failures.append(... "stub not yet implemented" ...)` f-strings were left verbatim), or `except` branch was touched. Verified mechanically (no `failures.append`/`print`/`def`/`return`/assignment lines in the diff) and by byte-identical zero-drift.
- **Post-Phase docs**: updated `user/scripts/CLAUDE.md` Testing section and `user/scripts/tests/baselines/README.md` to document the new `bug-state-test-baseline.txt` byte-pin and the shared cross-platform `_normalize_smoke_output` mechanism (temp-suffix + temp-root + separator canonicalization → platform-neutral baselines across Windows/WSL).
**Integration notes:**
- Integration verification: no module wiring occurred (this phase adds only test data, a baseline mechanism, and comment cleanup) — nothing previously isolated was connected. The baseline tests ARE full-stack (subprocess → script → observable stdout → byte assertion), so external-output coverage exists for the only "user-facing API" touched (`--test`/`--repo-root`).
- Final phase gate: all 3 regression gates exit 0; both scripts' `--repo-root` output byte-identical to phase-start (zero behavior change); full `test_lazy_core.py` suite 82/82.
**Pitfalls & guidance:**
- The `except NotImplementedError`/`except TypeError` guards in both smoke harnesses are dead code (compute_state/enqueue_adhoc/scope kwargs are implemented) but were RETAINED — WU-4 was scoped to comments only, so removing executable branches was out of scope.
**Files modified:**
- `user/scripts/bug-state.py` — docstring + 4 stale comments (comments/docstring only)
- `user/scripts/lazy-state.py` — 2 stale scope comments (comments only)
- `user/scripts/test_lazy_core.py` — 3 stale test docstrings + 2 inline comments (docstring/comments only)
- `user/scripts/CLAUDE.md` — Testing section (bug-state baseline + cross-platform normalization)
- `user/scripts/tests/baselines/README.md` — bug-state-test-baseline.txt section + shared normalization note

## Phase 2 — Integrity side-doors (P0)

**Goal:** No model-authorable path to VALIDATED/SKIP/receipts; content-validated receipts;
cloud gates in bug-state; standing-directive confirmation.

**Entry criteria:** Phase 1 baselines green.

**Deliverables:**
- [x] `lazy_core.has_completion_receipt()` validates frontmatter (`kind:`, `provenance:`); malformed → treated missing + diagnostic
- [x] bug-state cloud Step-2 skip + Step-10 hard-halt (mirror lazy-state); dead terminals resolved
- [x] Unqueued Fixed-no-receipt bypass closed (uniform receipt gate or diagnostic)
- [x] `MCP_TEST_RESULTS.md` commit-sha freshness check before `__write_validated_from_results__`
- [x] `SKIP_MCP_TEST.md` `granted_by: operator|pipeline`; coverage-audit + `__write_validated_from_skip__` honor it
- [x] D6: LOOP-DETECTED block restricted to NEEDS_INPUT/BLOCKED (all 3 orchestrators) + stale anchor fixed
- [x] Step 1e.4a: no evidence-less verification-box ticking; mismatch → NEEDS_INPUT
- [x] Input-audit runs after needs-input/blocked spec cycles; >4-decision overflow → durable follow-up NEEDS_INPUT
- [x] Standing-directive echo-back protocol; no early stop with budget+queue remaining; non-integer max_cycles rejected with question
- [x] D5: mcp-test inline-fix policy (test-first, disclosed, never self-certifies) in prompt overrides

**Runtime Verification:**
- [x] All three regression gates green
- [x] New fixtures: empty receipt → completion-unverified; cloud deferral → halt not `__mark_fixed__`; stale-sha results → no validation; pipeline-granted skip → NEEDS_INPUT

**Implementation Notes:**

#### Implementation Notes (Phase 2 — Batch 1: WU-1, WU-2, WU-4, WU-6)
**Completed:** 2026-06-10
**Review verdict:** PASS-WITH-FIXES (orchestrator review; all subagent ground-truth blocks independently re-run and diffed; one falsified subagent claim caught + corrected — see below)
**Work completed:**
- **WU-1** (`lazy_core.has_completion_receipt`): replaced the bare `.exists()` with content validation — a present receipt now counts ONLY if `parse_sentinel` yields `kind ∈ {completed, fixed}` AND a non-empty `provenance:`. Absent file → `False` silently; present-but-malformed → `_diag(...)` loud diagnostic + treated as missing (so `completion-unverified` still halts). Closes the `touch COMPLETED.md` side-door. 9 new unit tests in `test_lazy_core.py` (7 RED→GREEN + 2 positive guards incl. the `FIXED.md`/`kind: fixed` variant); existing `test_has_completion_receipt_present` updated to write a valid receipt.
- **WU-2** (`bug-state.py` cloud guards + dead terminals): mirrored lazy-state's two cloud guards — (1) Step-2 cloud-saturated skip (`cloud` + RETRO_DONE.md + DEFERRED_NON_CLOUD.md + no VALIDATED.md → `cloud_saturated_skipped` + continue) and (2) Step-10 defensive cloud hard-halt — so a cloud bug with DEFERRED_NON_CLOUD.md and no VALIDATED.md HALTS (`cloud-queue-exhausted`) instead of falling through to `__mark_fixed__` (archive-with-zero-validation). Both previously-dead terminals are now WIRED: `TR_CLOUD_QUEUE_EXHAUSTED` (cloud-saturated terminal + Step-10 halt) and `TR_QUEUE_MISSING` (emitted when `docs/bugs/queue.json` is entirely absent, distinct from all-bugs-fixed). New fixtures `cloud-defer-no-validate-halts` (RED→GREEN) and `queue-json-missing`; `bug-state-test-baseline.txt` regenerated via `_normalize_smoke_output`.
- **WU-4** (`lazy-state.py` MCP-results sha freshness): added best-effort `_current_head(repo_root)` (git `rev-parse HEAD`, `None` on non-repo) and a freshness gate in the workstation Step-9 all-passing branch — when HEAD is known AND `MCP_TEST_RESULTS.md`'s `validated_commit` differs, route to `sub_skill: mcp-test` ("Step 9: stale MCP results — re-verify") instead of `__write_validated_from_results__`. Backward-compatible: head unknown OR `validated_commit` absent → check skipped (preserves all other fixtures). `validated_commit` field added to the `MCP_TEST_RESULTS.md` schema in `sentinel-frontmatter.md`. New git-initialized fixture `stale-mcp-results-reverify` (RED→GREEN); `lazy-state-test-baseline.txt` regenerated (two-run determinism confirmed — no sha leakage).
- **WU-6** (D6 LOOP-DETECTED + Step 1e.4a, prose): in all 3 batch SKILLs the LOOP-DETECTED loop-breaker's "write the missing sentinel directly" license was removed and replaced with the locked-D6 allow-list — a loop-breaker may author ONLY `NEEDS_INPUT.md`/`BLOCKED.md`, never `VALIDATED.md`/`SKIP_MCP_TEST.md`/`RETRO_DONE.md`/receipts. The stale base-prompt anchor in lazy-batch (`"follow the skill's internal subagent-vs-orchestrator rules."` — no longer present) was repointed to the base prompt's real closing sentence. Step 1e.4a recovery now forbids evidence-less verification-box ticking: a box may be ticked only with on-disk evidence (`VALIDATED.md`/`MCP_TEST_RESULTS.md`); on mismatch the recovery writes `NEEDS_INPUT.md`. FULL treatment on lazy-batch + lazy-batch-cloud; MINIMAL inline patch on lazy-bug-batch (per Rule 10 — Phase 6 rebuilds it).
**Ground-truth verification:** All four agents produced GROUND-TRUTH blocks; orchestrator independently re-ran every block's commands and diffed (LOC/grep/status/test-counts all matched). **One falsified claim caught:** the WU-4 impl-agent reported 3 failing `test_derive_stage_done_*` tests as "pre-existing WIP." `git show HEAD:` proved they were committed and part of the 82/82 green baseline — they were broken by WU-1's tightening (`derive_stage` consumes `has_completion_receipt`). This is a propagation failure WU-1 should have caught; fixed via a dedicated Sonnet fix-agent that updated the 3 derive_stage fixtures to write VALID receipts (intent-preserving) → suite now 91/91.
**Fixes applied by orchestrator:** removed two untracked junk files (`...Temprun1.txt`/`run2.txt`) the WU-4 agent accidentally created via a redirect mishap.
**Integration / follow-up notes:**
- **WU-4 producer gap (follow-up):** the freshness gate is the CONSUMER half. It stays backward-compatibly inert until the `MCP_TEST_RESULTS.md` PRODUCER (the `/mcp-test` results writer / mcp-integration-test path) populates `validated_commit`. Per the plan WU-4 file-list (`lazy-state.py` + `sentinel-frontmatter.md` only) the producer-wiring was deliberately NOT done here — flagged for a follow-up (natural fit for the Phase 6 contradiction sweep). No regression: absent-field path == prior behavior.
- All three regression gates exit 0 after this batch.
**Files modified:** `user/scripts/lazy_core.py`, `user/scripts/bug-state.py`, `user/scripts/lazy-state.py`, `user/scripts/test_lazy_core.py`, `user/scripts/tests/baselines/bug-state-test-baseline.txt`, `user/scripts/tests/baselines/lazy-state-test-baseline.txt`, `user/skills/_components/sentinel-frontmatter.md`, `user/skills/lazy-batch/SKILL.md`, `repos/algobooth/.claude/skills/lazy-batch-cloud/SKILL.md`, `user/skills/lazy-bug-batch/SKILL.md`

#### Implementation Notes (Phase 2 — Batch 2: WU-3, WU-5, WU-7)
**Completed:** 2026-06-10
**Review verdict:** PASS (orchestrator review; all ground-truth blocks independently re-run; gates green; combined-tree coherence confirmed after a concurrent-edit stash maneuver — see process note)
**Work completed:**
- **WU-3** (`bug-state.py` unqueued Fixed-no-receipt bypass): `_find_open_bug_dirs` previously dropped EVERY dir whose status ∈ `_BUG_DONE_STATUSES` before any receipt check, so an unqueued on-disk bug flipped to Fixed without a `FIXED.md` receipt bypassed the gate entirely. Now special-cased: `Won't-fix` → skip (receipt-exempt); `Fixed` WITH a valid `FIXED.md` (`has_completion_receipt`) → skip (genuinely done); `Fixed` WITHOUT receipt → surfaced (`_diag` + returned) so the queue-walk gate fires `completion-unverified` — uniform with the queued path. Reuses the now-content-validating `has_completion_receipt` (a `touch FIXED.md` won't satisfy it). New fixture `unqueued-fixed-no-receipt-halt` (RED→GREEN); `bug-state-test-baseline.txt` regenerated. `wont-fix-exempt` + `fixed-no-receipt-halt` unregressed.
- **WU-5** (`lazy-state.py` SKIP_MCP_TEST provenance): both `__write_validated_from_skip__` emission sites (cloud Step-9 + workstation Step-9) now parse `SKIP_MCP_TEST.md` and refuse `granted_by: pipeline` → route to `needs-input` (a pipeline-self-granted skip can't vacuously validate; needs operator confirmation). Backward-compatible: absent / `operator` / non-`pipeline` → unchanged validate-from-skip. `granted_by: operator|pipeline` added to the `SKIP_MCP_TEST.md` schema in `sentinel-frontmatter.md`; `mcp-coverage-audit.md` step 2 now treats only `operator` (or absent) grants as a legitimate vacuous-pass, a `pipeline` grant as uncovered → surface. New fixtures `skip-pipeline-granted-needs-input` (RED→GREEN) + `skip-operator-granted-validates` (positive guard); `lazy-state-test-baseline.txt` regenerated.
- **WU-7** (input-audit + standing-directive, prose; FULL on lazy-batch, MINIMAL on lazy-bug-batch): (A) Step 1d.5 now runs after EVERY `/spec`|`plan-feature` cycle before the next state probe — a subsequent `needs-input`/`blocked` routing no longer exempts the cycle's audit (double-fire guard preserved). (B) >4-decision audit overflow now persists as durable follow-up `NEEDS_INPUT.md` sentinels (re-surface via Step 1g) instead of a buried `## Open Questions` body. (C) Standing-directive echo-back: a mid-run operator message implying a budget change / standing resolution mode / early stop must be confirmed via ONE `AskUserQuestion` before the mode takes effect; the orchestrator must never end a run with budget AND queue both remaining without asking. (D) Ambiguous/non-integer `max_cycles` (e.g. "infinity") → ONE clarifying `AskUserQuestion`, never a silent coerce. HARD CONSTRAINT 5 updated to enumerate the two new permitted orchestrator-level `AskUserQuestion` uses. lazy-batch-cloud confirmed already by-reference for Step 1d.5 (no edit needed, no follow-up).
**Ground-truth verification:** All three agents produced GROUND-TRUTH blocks; orchestrator independently re-ran all three regression gates (exit 0), the full `test_lazy_core.py` suite (91/91), `git stash list` (empty — no residue), and read the substantive `_find_open_bug_dirs` and lazy-batch prose edits. No falsified claims.
**Process note:** the WU-3 agent used a transient `git stash`/`stash pop` to isolate the working tree from WU-5's concurrent lazy-state edits. It left no residue (empty stash list) and the combined tree is coherent (all gates green, all eight expected files present + correct). No harm; flagged so future concurrent batches avoid in-agent stashing.
**Follow-up notes (carried from Batch 1 + new):**
- WU-4 producer gap (validated_commit recording by the MCP_TEST_RESULTS.md producer) still open — Phase 6 candidate.
- bug-state.py has its own `__write_validated_from_skip__` skip paths (Step 9, ~704-720) that do NOT yet honor `granted_by` — WU-5 was scoped to lazy-state.py only per the plan. Flagged for the lazy-bug-batch rebuild / a future parity pass (Phase 6).
**Files modified:** `user/scripts/bug-state.py`, `user/scripts/lazy-state.py`, `user/scripts/tests/baselines/bug-state-test-baseline.txt`, `user/scripts/tests/baselines/lazy-state-test-baseline.txt`, `user/skills/_components/sentinel-frontmatter.md`, `user/skills/_components/mcp-coverage-audit.md`, `user/skills/lazy-batch/SKILL.md`, `user/skills/lazy-bug-batch/SKILL.md`

#### Implementation Notes (Phase 2 — Batch 3: WU-8 + Post-Phase)
**Completed:** 2026-06-10
**Review verdict:** PASS (inline review — 2 files, 30 insertions, ≤150 lines; prose-only, ground-truth verified by grep + reading the inserted D5 block)
**Work completed:**
- **WU-8** (D5 mcp-test inline-fix policy, prose): added the locked-D5 inline-fix policy to the `/mcp-test` per-skill override in both batch SKILLs. A mcp-test cycle MAY fix production code inline ONLY (1) test-first (failing test written + confirmed RED first) and (2) fully disclosed (files/change/pinning-test named in the cycle summary); (3) a cycle that modified production code MUST NOT write `VALIDATED.md` — it ends in a needs-re-verify state (`MCP_TEST_RESULTS.md` flagging the production change, or `BLOCKED.md`); (4) only a SUBSEQUENT clean `/mcp-test` cycle (no production edits) certifies via `VALIDATED.md`. The existing NO-FIRE-AND-FORGET sentinel-contract clause was updated with the matching "VALIDATED.md on full pass UNLESS you modified production code this cycle" exception so it reads coherently. FULL on lazy-batch (numbered 1–4 block); MINIMAL terse suffix on lazy-bug-batch (per Rule 10). Closes the self-certification side-door where one cycle both changes and validates its own un-reviewed code.
**Ground-truth verification:** prose WU (TDD:no) — no test runner applies; verified by independent grep (D5 language present in both files at the expected sites) + reading the inserted block for coherence with the surrounding sentinel contract.

#### Post-Phase (Phase 2 — Integration Verification + part close)
**Integration verification:** the five integrity gates cohere as one system —
(1) content-validated receipts (`has_completion_receipt`, WU-1) feed both the lazy-state Step-2 and bug-state Fixed-receipt completion gates AND `derive_stage`; (2) the bug-state cloud guards (WU-2) + the unqueued-Fixed gate (WU-3) make bug-state's completion enforcement uniform with lazy-state's; (3) the MCP-results sha-freshness gate (WU-4) + SKIP_MCP_TEST `granted_by` provenance (WU-5) close the two "validate from stale/self-granted evidence" side-doors; (4) the loop-breaker sentinel restriction + 1e.4a evidence gate (WU-6) prevent recovery subagents from authoring validation sentinels; (5) the mcp-test inline-fix policy (WU-8) prevents a cycle self-certifying its own code change. The orchestrator-facing WU-6/WU-7/WU-8 skill edits are FULL on lazy-batch + lazy-batch-cloud (cloud's Step 1d.5 is by-reference) and MINIMAL on lazy-bug-batch — Phase 6 rebuilds lazy-bug-batch by-reference and inherits the canonical lazy-batch text (per the plan's accepted "Phase 2 edits text Phase 6 later replaces" risk note).
**Part-end full quality gate (MANDATORY, all exit 0):** `python3 ~/.claude/scripts/lazy-state.py --test` (0), `python3 ~/.claude/scripts/bug-state.py --test` (0), `python3 ~/.claude/scripts/test_lazy_core.py` (91/91, 0). Run + passed as the final chained command before the part-close commit.
**Carried follow-ups (Phase 6 candidates, NOT blocking part close):**
- WU-4 producer gap: the `MCP_TEST_RESULTS.md` producer (`/mcp-test` results writer) must populate `validated_commit` for the freshness gate to be active in production (gate is backward-compatibly inert until then; no regression).
- bug-state.py `__write_validated_from_skip__` paths (Step 9) do not yet honor `granted_by` (WU-5 was lazy-state-scoped per the plan).
- CLAUDE.md review: `user/scripts/CLAUDE.md` testing section already documents the baseline mechanism (Phase 1); no new doc wiring warranted by Phase 2's guard/validation additions (no new public surface).
**Files modified:** `user/skills/lazy-batch/SKILL.md`, `user/skills/lazy-bug-batch/SKILL.md`

## Phase 3 — Routing & parser fixes

**Goal:** Eliminate the state-script blind spots that burn Opus cycles.

**Entry criteria:** Phase 1 baselines green (Phase 2 independent).

**Deliverables:**
- [x] bug-state emits `plan-bug` on concluded investigation (conclusion marker documented in SPEC template); lazy-bug-batch description updated
- [x] Fence-aware `- [ ]` parsing in `count_deliverables` / `remaining_unchecked_are_verification_only` / `_unchecked_wus_in_plan_scope` (+ fixture fix)
- [x] Verification-only heuristic anchored to `## Runtime Verification` heading (no bold-marker clash)
- [x] Verification-row placement convention pinned in write-plan component / PHASES template
- [x] `roadmap_marks_complete` / `upstream_is_complete` / `is_stub_spec` anchored (no substring collisions)
- [x] Stale already-applied plan → inline flip pseudo-action (not execute-plan)
- [x] D3: split forward/meta counters (meta ceiling 2× max_cycles) + cap check at top of every resolution mode; halt-resolution.md claim fixed
- [x] `scoped-id-not-found` terminal; diagnostics for malformed queue entries
- [x] Realign mtime gate → recorded upstream-PHASES hash; `check_stale_upstream` wired to CLI/probe; Step-10 unexpected-state writes its NEEDS_INPUT.md

**Runtime Verification:**
- [x] Regression gates green
- [x] Fixtures: concluded investigation → plan-bug; fenced checkboxes ignored; substring-collision row → no false halt; stale plan → flip; typo'd scope id → scoped-id-not-found

**Implementation Notes:**

#### Implementation Notes (Phase 3 — Batch 1: WU-1, WU-2, WU-3, WU-4)
**Completed:** 2026-06-10
**Review verdict:** PASS-WITH-FIXES → fixes applied → PASS (dedicated Opus reviewer; orchestrator independently re-ran all 3 gates + diffed every subagent GROUND-TRUTH block — all matched, no falsified reports, HEAD unchanged so no rogue commits)
**Work completed:**
- **WU-1** (plan-bug wiring, TDD): `bug-state.py` `compute_state()` Step 4 now reads `spec_status(spec_dir)` (already imported from `lazy_core`, line-anchored `^**Status:**` match) and emits `sub_skill="plan-bug"` (new constant `SKILL_PLAN_BUG`, line 114; emit at ~692) when SPEC `**Status:** Concluded` AND no PHASES.md — instead of looping `spec-bug`. Any other status (e.g. `Investigating`) → unchanged `spec-bug`. Two smoke fixtures (`concluded-investigation-plan-bug` RED→GREEN; `concluded-investigation-guard-still-spec-bug` discriminating guard). `lazy-bug-batch/SKILL.md` frontmatter + body (~454) updated: bug-state now emits `plan-bug` (still never `plan-feature`). **Loop closed end-to-end (review fix):** `spec-bug/SKILL.md` Step 6 now WRITES `**Status:** Concluded` at a proven conclusion (interactive + `--batch` paths); unconcluded batch runs leave `Investigating` + write `NEEDS_INPUT.md` (never falsely Concluded). `plan-bug/SKILL.md` Status gate now lists `Concluded` as a proceed-state. Verified wiring is NOT a dead-end: `lazy-bug-batch` dispatches `{sub_skill}` generically and `/plan-bug` exists.
- **WU-2** (fence-aware + bold-clash parsing, TDD): `lazy_core.py` `count_deliverables`, `remaining_unchecked_are_verification_only`, `_unchecked_wus_in_plan_scope` now track an `in_fence` flag (toggle on `stripped.startswith("```")`, handles ```` ```lang ````) and skip `- [ ]`/`- [x]` lines inside code fences. The verification-only heuristic no longer treats a NON-verification bold (`**Assessment:**`) as a scope boundary — only verification-pattern bolds/headings enter scope; `**Runtime Verification**`/`**MCP Integration Test Assertions:**` bold markers still recognized (backward-compat). 9 unit tests in `test_lazy_core.py` (6 RED→GREEN + 3 backward-compat guards incl. the non-tautological "real task outside → False" discriminator).
- **WU-3** (placement convention, docs): `_components/phases-runtime-verification.md` + `write-plan/SKILL.md` pin the rule that runtime-verification `- [ ]` checkboxes live ONLY under `## Runtime Verification` (or the `**Runtime Verification**`/`**MCP...**` bold subsection), NEVER under a phase's `### Deliverables`; fenced rows are illustrative. This is the convention WU-2's heuristic depends on.
- **WU-4** (substring anchoring, TDD): `lazy-state.py` `roadmap_marks_complete` + `upstream_is_complete` now extract the `~~...~~` strikethrough name (pre-` — ` token, trimmed) and compare for case-insensitive EQUALITY — a feature name that is a substring/prefix of a different completed feature no longer false-matches (`Audio` ≠ `Audio Engine`). `is_stub_spec` anchors the `Draft (pre-Gemini)` match to the `**Status:**` line / `>` blockquote trailer (prose mention no longer false-flags a stub). 3 smoke fixtures (RED→GREEN). Baseline regenerated via `_normalize_smoke_output`; **pre-regen diff confirmed purely additive** — zero pre-existing fixture routing changed (no over-reach; reviewer independently confirmed `all-complete`/`needs-realign` positive-detection fixtures still pass).
**Integration notes:**
- File-ownership reconciliation: the `workstation-verification-only-bold-marker` fixture (WU-2's "fix the fixture") lives INSIDE `lazy-state.py`, which WU-4 also edits → assigned ALL `lazy-state.py` edits to the WU-4 owner; ran WU-4 impl after WU-2 impl so the lazy-state baseline reflects the new `lazy_core` behavior. Confirmed WU-2's fence change does NOT alter any existing lazy-state/bug-state fixture routing (the bold-marker fixture's fenced row is now skipped but its non-fenced verification row keeps it verification-only → Step 8 retro unchanged).
- `plan-bug` is now a live `bug-state.py` emit; Phase 6's lazy-bug-batch by-reference rebuild inherits the description update.
- Byte-pinned baselines pinned to LF via new `tests/baselines/.gitattributes` (`*.txt text eol=lf`) — protects the verbatim-comparison contract (incl. Phase 1/2 baselines) under `core.autocrlf` on Windows.
**Pitfalls & guidance:**
- The marker is `**Status:** Concluded` — a NEW status value (not the plan's alternate `In-progress` suggestion, which is overloaded by plan frontmatter). spec-bug must WRITE it at conclusion; bug-state only READS it. A premature `Concluded` would make `/plan-bug` fabricate phases from incomplete findings — spec-bug's batch guard explicitly prevents this (unconcluded → `NEEDS_INPUT.md`).
- `roadmap_marks_complete`'s equality match assumes ROADMAP grammar `~~<Name> — <desc>~~ … **COMPLETE**` (documented in the function's docstring). A non-`Name — desc` strikethrough shape would require an exact-name match — a latent edge case to watch, not a current regression.
**Part-end gate status:** all three gates exit 0 (lazy-state --test, bug-state --test, test_lazy_core.py 100/100) — confirmed fresh by the orchestrator post-fixes. (NOT the final part gate — Batches 2-4 remain.)
**Files modified:**

#### Implementation Notes (Phase 3 — Batch 2: WU-5, WU-6)
**Completed:** 2026-06-10
**Review verdict:** PASS-WITH-FIXES → fixes applied → PASS (dedicated Opus reviewer; reviewer md5-matched the live `~/.claude/scripts/*.py` to the repo and read all 3 SKILL diffs in full; the D3 model independently confirmed COMPLETE + CONSISTENT across all 3 SKILLs + halt-resolution; 5 minor text stragglers fixed)
**Work completed:**
- **WU-5** (stale already-applied plan → inline flip, TDD): `lazy-state.py` `compute_state()` Step 7 — before the cloud-saturated flip and the execute-plan dispatch — now emits `sub_skill="__flip_plan_complete_stale__"` (current_step `Step 7a: flip plan Complete (stale — all referenced deliverables already checked)`) when `_plan_phase_set(plan)` is NON-EMPTY and `_unchecked_wus_in_plan_scope(phases_text, phase_set)` is EMPTY (every WU the Ready/In-progress plan references is already `[x]`). The non-empty phase-set guard is required (a no-`phases:` plan has unknown scope → falls through to execute-plan, never falsely flips). Prevents the `Step 7a: execute plan` no-op loop that burned two Opus dispatches re-verifying already-applied plans. 2 smoke fixtures (`stale-plan-all-refs-checked-flips` RED→GREEN; `ready-plan-unchecked-in-scope-still-executes` non-tautological guard). Baseline regen confirmed purely additive.
- **WU-6** (D3 split counters + cap reachability + halt-resolution fix, prose; LOCKED D3): the single session-global `cycle` counter is replaced in ALL 3 batch orchestrators (`lazy-batch`, `lazy-bug-batch`, `lazy-batch-cloud`) + the shared `halt-resolution.md` by TWO monotonic counters — `forward_cycles` (pipeline work; ceiling `max_cycles`; capped at Step 1c) and `meta_cycles` (resolution/recovery/cleanup; ceiling `2 * max_cycles`; capped at the TOP of every resolution mode 1g/1h/1i + the top of the halt-resolution algorithm). The meta-cap-at-top is the load-bearing fix for the unreachable-cap bug (the `1a→1b→1g/1h/1i→1a` resolution loop previously bypassed the Step 1c cap, so resolution/re-prompt loops were unbounded). Increment classification: real-skill (1e) + pipeline-advancing pseudo-skills (`__mark_complete__`/`__mark_fixed__`, `__write_*__`, `__flip_plan_complete_cloud_saturated__`) → forward; resolution modes + `__flip_plan_complete_stale__` → meta; input-audits increment neither (bounded by the surrounding cycle). Both counters reported in the per-cycle heading (Step 3, uniform `### Cycle fwd {forward_cycles+1}/{max_cycles} · meta {meta_cycles}/{2*max_cycles} · …`) and the final batch report (Step 2). HARD CONSTRAINT 8 rewritten for the two-counter model. `halt-resolution.md` line-199 "max_cycles bounds it regardless" claim corrected to reference the meta-cycle cap (now the true bound).
- **WU-5 orchestrator wiring (folded into WU-6 to keep SKILLs single-writer):** `__flip_plan_complete_stale__` added to the Step 1c.5 inline-handler list in all 3 SKILLs (flip plan frontmatter `status:` → `Complete`, commit `chore(<id>): mark plan part N Complete (stale — already applied)`), classified META, and distinguished from `__flip_plan_complete_cloud_saturated__` (forward + cloud-only). Verified NOT a dead-end: lazy-state emits the exact same string the handlers consume.
**Integration notes:**
- Reviewer flagged the WU-6 impl agent's "already complete from a previous session" claim as FALSE (HEAD had 0 `forward_cycles`; the work was uncommitted current-session). Orchestrator independently re-verified every D3 structural element on disk (inits, forward cap @1c, meta-cap @ top of 1g/1h/1i ×3 SKILLs, stale handler ×3, final-report lines, no leftover bare `cycle`) before accepting — the deliverable was present and correct, only the narrative was mislabeled.
- **Follow-up (Phase 6 candidate, NOT a Batch-2 defect):** `bug-state.py` (~L731 `else: plan = plans[0]` → execute-plan) has the SAME stale-plan vulnerability but WU-5 was scoped to `lazy-state.py` only. `lazy-bug-batch/SKILL.md` now documents the `__flip_plan_complete_stale__` handler (consistent with the pre-existing convention where it also documents `__flip_plan_complete_cloud_saturated__` that bug-state.py never emits) — the bug-pipeline stale gate is a documented-but-unimplemented forward reference until a future phase adds it to `bug-state.py`.
**Pitfalls & guidance:**
- D3 counter consistency across the 3 large SKILLs is the #1 correctness requirement — the heading + final-report formats are byte-identical by design; any future edit to one orchestrator's counter text must mirror the other two (until Phase 6 makes lazy-bug-batch by-reference).
- The shared `halt-resolution.md` meta-cap message was made skill-agnostic (no hardcoded "lazy-batch") since all 3 orchestrators consume it.
**Part-end gate status:** all 3 gates exit 0 (lazy-state --test, bug-state --test, test_lazy_core.py 100/100) — confirmed fresh post-fixes. (NOT the final part gate — Batches 3-4 remain.)
**Files modified:**
- `user/scripts/lazy-state.py` — Step 7 stale-flip branch + 2 fixtures
- `user/scripts/tests/baselines/lazy-state-test-baseline.txt` — regenerated
- `user/skills/lazy-batch/SKILL.md`, `user/skills/lazy-bug-batch/SKILL.md`, `repos/algobooth/.claude/skills/lazy-batch-cloud/SKILL.md` — D3 two-counter model + `__flip_plan_complete_stale__` handler
- `user/skills/_components/halt-resolution.md` — meta-cap check + meta_cycles increment + line-199 fix

#### Implementation Notes (Phase 3 — Batch 3: WU-7)
**Completed:** 2026-06-10
**Review verdict:** PASS-WITH-FIXES → fixes applied → PASS (dedicated Opus reviewer; traced flag-placement + terminal-ordering by hand, ran all 3 suites green; caught a real scoped-deliverable gap)
**Work completed:**
- **WU-7** (scoped-id-not-found terminal + queue diagnostics, TDD; BOTH state scripts): a typo'd `--feature-id`/`--bug-id` (scope id matching no queue entry) previously fell through to `all-features-complete`/`all-bugs-fixed` — falsely reporting "all done." Both scripts now track a `scope_id_seen` flag set the instant a queue entry's id EQUALS the scope id (BEFORE any completion/cloud/device/deferred skip can `continue` past it — so a scoped feature that matched but is already complete still routes to its REAL terminal, NOT not-found), and emit a distinct `scoped-id-not-found` terminal (identical literal string in both; `TR_SCOPED_ID_NOT_FOUND` constant in bug-state) immediately before the all-complete fall-through. Added to both `terminal_reason` doc-enums. 2 fixtures RED→GREEN; positive scoping guards (`scoped-feature-id`/`scope-bug-id-two-bugs`) stay green as discriminators.
- **Queue diagnostics:** both scripts now emit a `_diag` when a queue entry is skipped for missing `id`/`name`/`spec_dir` (bug-state's walk-loop skip ~L478 and lazy-state's ~L930 — both previously silent). The diagnostic names the missing fields using the OPERATOR-FACING queue.json keys (`id`/`name`/`spec_dir`, not internal normalized names) so the operator knows which JSON field to fix.
**Integration notes:**
- Reviewer verified terminal ORDERING: when scoping to a not-found id, every skip-list (cloud/device/research/operator-deferred) is provably empty (they populate only post-match), so placing the not-found check right before all-complete cannot shadow `device-queue-exhausted`/`queue-blocked-on-research`/`cloud-queue-exhausted`; conversely when one of those is the real reason `scope_id_seen` is True so the not-found check is bypassed. `queue-missing` intentionally still takes precedence (more specific). Both scripts symmetric.
- Review fixes applied: lazy-state's malformed-entry `_diag` (the explicitly-scoped half that the impl agent initially did only in bug-state) + bug-state's diagnostic now reports `spec_dir` (operator key) not `spec_path` (internal key).
- Downstream note (out of scope): the lazy/lazy-bug single-dispatch skills have no explicit terminal-table row for `scoped-id-not-found`, but their generic clean-stop fallback prints `notify_message` and STOPs — degrades gracefully, no crash. An explicit row is a future nice-to-have.
**Part-end gate status:** all 3 gates exit 0 (lazy-state --test, bug-state --test, test_lazy_core.py 100/100) — confirmed fresh post-fixes. (NOT the final part gate — Batch 4 remains.)
**Files modified:**
- `user/scripts/lazy-state.py` — scope_id_seen flag + scoped-id-not-found terminal + malformed-entry _diag + 1 fixture
- `user/scripts/bug-state.py` — TR_SCOPED_ID_NOT_FOUND + flag + terminal + malformed-entry _diag + 1 fixture
- `user/scripts/tests/baselines/{lazy-state,bug-state}-test-baseline.txt` — regenerated (additive)

#### Implementation Notes (Phase 3 — Batch 4: WU-8 + Post-Phase)
**Completed:** 2026-06-10
**Review verdict:** PASS-WITH-FIXES → fixes applied → PASS (dedicated Opus reviewer; manually reconstructed + `yaml.safe_load`-parsed the realign-spec template to prove the hash round-trip, verified the mtime fallback byte-for-byte, caught a real YAML-coercion bug)
**Work completed:**
- **WU-8a** (realign mtime → hash gate, TDD): `realign_is_fresh` now reads `upstream_phases_hashes` (a YAML map dir-name→sha256 hex) from the newest realign plan's frontmatter (parsed via `parse_sentinel`→`yaml.safe_load`, a real YAML parser) and is fresh iff every hard-complete upstream's current `_phases_sha(ud)` matches its recorded hash — replacing the unreliable mtime comparison (mtimes reset on git checkout/clone). **Legacy plans without the field fall back to the original mtime logic byte-for-byte** (backward-compat preserved). Companion writer: `realign-spec/SKILL.md` Step 4 now records `upstream_phases_hashes:` in the realign plan frontmatter (the reviewer confirmed the writer's YAML shape + key convention round-trip exactly to what the gate reads). Fixture `realign-hash-gate-detects-changed-upstream` (RED→GREEN: a hash mismatch under a newer-mtime plan now correctly routes to Step 4.6, where the old mtime gate said "fresh").
- **WU-8b** (`check_stale_upstream` wired, TDD): `compute_state` now auto-runs `check_stale_upstream(repo_root)` at probe start (after `clear_diagnostics()`, before the queue walk / Step 2.9), guarded by `docs/work/materialized.json` existence — the production trigger the stale-upstream halt previously lacked (it was only called from a smoke test). The common queue-only workflow (no materialized.json) is a byte-for-byte no-op. Fixture `stale-upstream-auto-wired-at-probe` (RED→GREEN end-to-end: seed materialized.json + newer mirror changedDate → auto-run writes STALE_UPSTREAM.md → Step 2.9 halts `stale_upstream`).
- **WU-8c** (Step-10 NEEDS_INPUT writer, TDD): new helper `_write_step10_needs_input(spec_dir, feature_name)` writes a well-formed `NEEDS_INPUT.md` (kind: needs-input, written_by, `## Decision Context` H2 with a 1:1 decisions↔H3 pairing) into the spec dir; the defensive Step-10 `if not entry_ok:` branch now calls it before returning needs-input. (The branch is provably UNREACHABLE via normal compute_state inputs — every workstation Step-9 sub-path returns when `validated_file` is absent — so it is a pure defensive guard; the helper is the honest testable unit, exercised directly by the fixture.) Review fix: the `decisions:` title contained a colon-space → unquoted YAML coerced it to a dict (schema violation breaking Step 1g's decisions↔H3 contract); quoted the value so it parses as a string, and tightened the fixture to assert `all(isinstance(x, str))` so the class can't regress.
**Integration verification (Post-Phase):** the Phase-3 routing fixes cohere as one system — the new terminals/pseudo-actions land at distinct compute_state steps (bug-state Step 4 plan-bug, lazy-state Step 7 stale-flip, queue-walk scoped-id-not-found, Step 2.9 stale-upstream auto-trigger, Step 10 helper) with no conflicts; the full fixture suite passes together (no false halts). Cross-WU wiring verified: WU-5's `__flip_plan_complete_stale__` emit ↔ WU-6 handler use the identical string; WU-2's fence-aware parser feeds WU-5's stale detection + WU-8's nothing; the smoke fixtures are full-stack (compute_state end-to-end → observable routing + sentinel writes). No new untested user-facing surface. CLAUDE.md review: `user/scripts/CLAUDE.md` references the terminal table abstractly (authoritative table = the `compute_state()` docstring/body, which the impl agents updated via the `terminal_reason` doc-enums) — no structural CLAUDE.md update warranted.
**Pitfalls & guidance:**
- The realign hash round-trip is a cross-file contract (`realign-spec/SKILL.md` writer ↔ `realign_is_fresh` reader): the frontmatter KEY must be the upstream DIR NAME and the VALUE `sha256(PHASES.md bytes).hexdigest()`. `parse_sentinel` uses `yaml.safe_load`, so the writer's YAML map must be valid (correct indent). A change to either side must preserve the shape.
- The defensive Step-10 branch is unreachable by design — do not attempt to make it reachable by re-routing the normal "RETRO_DONE + needs MCP test" state (that correctly dispatches /mcp-test); the deliverable is only that IF the guard ever fires it leaves a durable NEEDS_INPUT.md.
**Carried follow-ups (out of Phase 3 scope, future-phase candidates):**
- bug-state.py has the same stale-plan vulnerability (no `__flip_plan_complete_stale__` emit) — WU-5 was lazy-state-scoped (Phase 6 lazy-bug-batch rebuild candidate).
- lazy/lazy-bug single-dispatch skills lack an explicit terminal-table row for `scoped-id-not-found` (degrades gracefully via the generic clean-stop; explicit row is a nice-to-have).
**Part-end full quality gate (MANDATORY — all exit 0):** `python3 ~/.claude/scripts/lazy-state.py --test` (0), `python3 ~/.claude/scripts/bug-state.py --test` (0), `python3 ~/.claude/scripts/test_lazy_core.py` (100/100, 0) — run + passed fresh by the orchestrator post-fixes, immediately before the part-close commit.
**Files modified:**
- `user/scripts/lazy-state.py` — `_phases_sha` + hash-based `realign_is_fresh` (mtime fallback) + `import hashlib` + check_stale auto-wire + `_write_step10_needs_input` + branch call + 3 fixtures
- `user/skills/realign-spec/SKILL.md` — record `upstream_phases_hashes` in realign plan frontmatter
- `user/scripts/tests/baselines/lazy-state-test-baseline.txt` — regenerated (additive)

## Phase 4 — Parked-decision protocol + notifications (D1/D2)

**Goal:** Opt-in park-and-continue (`--park` skill flag) with batched flush; two-key
auto-accept (`--park` mode only); push on every park/halt in both modes. **Default (no flag)
behavior stays byte-for-byte the existing halt-and-wait.**

**Entry criteria:** Phase 3 (split counters land first — flush/park reporting uses them).

**Deliverables:**
- [x] `--park` skill invocation flag parsed in all 3 batch orchestrators; recorded in start banner + final report; no flag → existing Step 1g halt behavior unchanged
- [x] Script `--park-needs-input` mode + `parked[]` output array, passed only when skill got `--park` (wrappers keep halt behavior; probe output unchanged without the flag)
- [x] PushNotification at every park / halt / flush / run end (both modes)
- [x] D1 flush protocol (`--park` only): batched AskUserQuestion (≤4/call, Zero-Context Briefing preserved) at first opportunity (operator message / out of unparked work / run end); decision-apply per answer
- [x] D2 two-key auto-accept (`--park` only): `class: mechanical` + input-audit concurrence → recommended option auto-accepted, `resolved_by: auto-two-key`, receipt log + run-end digest; any disagreement → product → park; no auto-accept ever without `--park`
- [x] Cache-boundary note documented in both batch skills

**Runtime Verification:**
- [x] Default-mode regression: without `--park-needs-input`, a NEEDS_INPUT fixture still emits the `needs-input` halt (probe output byte-identical to Phase 1 baseline) — verified by the `park-needs-input-default-halt` / `bug-park-needs-input-default-halt` smoke sub-fixtures (assert `terminal_reason=="needs-input"` AND `parked` key absent) + the byte-pinned `--test` baseline-match tests + the zero-drift `--repo-root <AlgoBooth>` probe (no `parked` key in default output for either script)
- [x] Fixtures: with the flag, `parked[]` populated, parked item skipped not halted, resolved sentinel re-enters — verified by the `park-needs-input-mode-skip` (parked count=1, next entry dispatched) and `park-needs-input-resolved-reenter` (resolved sentinel → item re-dispatched, parked=[]) smoke sub-fixtures in both scripts (all green in `--test`)
- [x] lazy-batch-retro checklist additions: parks fire notifications; flush count matches parked count; every auto-accept carries two keys + digest entry; zero parks/auto-accepts in no-flag runs — **satisfied by Phase 6 Batch 1 WU-5 fix 6** (lazy-batch-retro §4a-P4 checks P4-1..P4-4, `repos/algobooth/.claude/skills/lazy-batch-retro/SKILL.md` lines 300-306)

**Implementation Notes:**

#### Implementation Notes (Phase 4 — Batch 1: WU-1, WU-2)
**Completed:** 2026-06-10
**Review verdict:** PASS-WITH-FIXES → fixes applied → PASS (dedicated Opus reviewer; orchestrator independently re-ran every subagent GROUND-TRUTH block and diffed — all matched, HEAD unchanged ec8a4cd so no rogue commits; zero-drift byte-identical default output confirmed for both scripts)
**Work completed:**
- **WU-1** (TDD, `--park-needs-input` script mode + `parked[]`): new shared helper `lazy_core.build_parked_entry(item_id, sentinel_path)` (lazy_core.py ~270) returns `{id, sentinel, decision_count, parked_since}` from a NEEDS_INPUT.md sentinel (reuses `parse_sentinel`; `decision_count`=len of `decisions:` list with `isinstance(list)` defensive guard → 0 on absent/empty/scalar; `parked_since`=`date:` field or None). Both `lazy-state.py` and `bug-state.py` gained: a `--park-needs-input` CLI flag (store_true) threaded as `park_needs_input: bool = False` into `compute_state`; module-level `_PARKED` + `_PARK_MODE` (reset at compute_state top alongside `_DEVICE_DEFERRED`/`clear_diagnostics`); a park-peek in the queue walk that — only under park mode AND when a `NEEDS_INPUT.md` exists AND no co-present `BLOCKED.md` — appends `build_parked_entry(...)` to `_PARKED`, emits a `_diag`, and `continue`s (skip-not-halt, modeled on the existing cloud/device/operator-defer skips), placed AFTER the receipt-gated completion gate so a genuinely-complete item is never parked. **Byte-identical invariant: `"parked"` is included in the output dict ONLY inside `if _PARK_MODE:` — the key is entirely absent in default mode**, verified by the zero-drift probe (`--repo-root <AlgoBooth>` has no `parked` key for either script) + the byte-pinned `--test` baseline-match tests. BLOCKED.md retains precedence under park mode (review fix). Re-entry is automatic (per-invocation `_PARKED.clear()`; no cross-call persistence).
- **WU-2** (prose): all 3 batch orchestrators (`lazy-batch`, `lazy-bug-batch`, `lazy-batch-cloud` SKILLs) parse an opt-in `--park` flag alongside `max_cycles` (position-independent), set `park_mode` (default false), record `Park mode: on|off` in BOTH the start banner and the final report, update the usage string to include `[--park]`, and state explicitly that without the flag behavior is byte-for-byte the existing Step 1g halt-and-wait. Park/flush/auto-accept semantics are cross-referenced to Steps 1g/1h/1i (deferred to Batches 2–4). Single-dispatch wrappers (`lazy`/`lazy-bug`/`lazy-cloud`) intentionally untouched (no `--park` there per Rule 10).
**Review fixes applied (Sonnet fix-agent):** (1) BLOCKED.md exclusion added to the park guard in both scripts (a feature/bug with BOTH BLOCKED.md and NEEDS_INPUT.md must still halt "blocked", not be silently parked) + new `*-blocked-precedence` smoke sub-fixture in both scripts locking it; (2) removed a stale "RED→GREEN" comment in lazy-state.py that didn't match the code; (3) tightened the `build_parked_entry` docstring (handles missing-file/missing-field/scalar defensively, but structurally-corrupt frontmatter still routes through `parse_sentinel`'s `_die`→exit 2, consistent with all sentinel parsing).
**Integration notes:**
- The `--park-needs-input` script flag is the CONSUMER half; WU-2 wired the `--park` SKILL flag that (in later batches) is what causes the orchestrator to PASS `--park-needs-input` to the script. The park/flush/auto-accept ORCHESTRATION (when to flush, PushNotification firing, AskUserQuestion batching, two-key auto-accept) is Batches 2–5 — WU-1/WU-2 are the plumbing.
- `parked[]` entry schema is `{id, sentinel, decision_count, parked_since}` — the WU-4 flush protocol and WU-5 digest consume these fields.
**Pitfalls & guidance:**
- The byte-identical contract hinges entirely on the `if _PARK_MODE:` gate in `_state`/`_bug_state`; any future field added to the parked path must stay inside that gate or it leaks into default output and breaks the baseline pins.
- Baselines were regenerated through `_normalize_smoke_output` (never hand-edited); diffs are purely additive (+4 lines each, 0 removals).
**Files modified:**
- `user/scripts/lazy_core.py` — `build_parked_entry` helper
- `user/scripts/lazy-state.py` — `--park-needs-input` flag + param + `_PARKED`/`_PARK_MODE` + park-peek (BLOCKED-excluded) + 4 park smoke sub-fixtures
- `user/scripts/bug-state.py` — symmetric to lazy-state
- `user/scripts/test_lazy_core.py` — 4 `build_parked_entry` unit tests + symbol-importability assertion (104/104)
- `user/scripts/tests/baselines/{lazy-state,bug-state}-test-baseline.txt` — regenerated (additive)
- `user/skills/lazy-batch/SKILL.md`, `user/skills/lazy-bug-batch/SKILL.md`, `repos/algobooth/.claude/skills/lazy-batch-cloud/SKILL.md` — `--park` flag parse + banner + final-report `Park mode:` line

#### Implementation Notes (Phase 4 — Batch 2: WU-3)
**Completed:** 2026-06-10
**Review verdict:** PASS (dedicated Opus reviewer; orchestrator ground-truth verified — diff purely additive +33/-0 across 3 files, HEAD unchanged 35945f4, existing per-terminal PushNotification lines preserved)
**Work completed:**
- **WU-3** (prose, all 3 batch SKILLs): added a consolidating `### 1c.6. PushNotification policy (park / halt / flush / run-end)` subsection enumerating the four orchestrator-fired notification points with correct mode-gating — **park** (`--park` only, per newly-parked item, carries running parked-count), **halt** (BOTH modes), **flush** (`--park` only, forward-ref to WU-4), **run-end** (BOTH modes) — and stating PushNotification is orchestrator-fired (scripts never call it). Also added a "Park mode — processing `parked[]` output" instruction at Step 1g: when `park_mode==true` and the probe returns a non-empty `parked[]`, the orchestrator fires the park notification per newly-parked item (incrementing `parked_count`) and continues the queue walk without halting. Existing per-terminal PushNotification lines preserved (not rewritten). lazy-bug-batch uses `bug_name`; feature variants use `feature_name`; cloud's halt list includes `cloud-queue-exhausted` — per-variant accuracy, gating phrases identical across all three.
**Integration notes:**
- The park-notification point consumes WU-1's `parked[]` script output. The flush point is a forward reference to WU-4 (next batch) — documented now so the four-point policy reads coherently.
**Files modified:**
- `user/skills/lazy-batch/SKILL.md`, `user/skills/lazy-bug-batch/SKILL.md`, `repos/algobooth/.claude/skills/lazy-batch-cloud/SKILL.md` — §1c.6 policy + Step 1g parked[] processing

#### Implementation Notes (Phase 4 — Batch 3: WU-4)
**Completed:** 2026-06-10
**Review verdict:** PASS (dedicated Opus reviewer verified all 8 locked requirements present+correct; orchestrator ground-truth verified — new component 201 lines, 3 SKILLs +91/-3, HEAD unchanged a22c526, mount-site satisfied)
**Work completed:**
- **WU-4** (D1 flush protocol, `--park` only): created the shared component `user/skills/_components/parked-flush.md` (the batched, park-mode-only sibling of `decision-resume.md`), referenced by all 3 batch SKILLs via a new `### 1g-flush. Parked-decision flush (--park only)` section with pipeline-binding paragraph (same pattern as the Step 1g `decision-resume.md` include). The component specifies: hard `park_mode==true` gate (never fires without `--park`); the three flush triggers at the FIRST of (a) operator message mid-run, (b) **no-unparked-work guard** — the orchestrator MUST NOT treat an all-complete/queue-exhausted terminal as a real STOP while unresolved parked items remain (flush first — this is the load-bearing anti-abandonment point), (c) run end; meta-cap check FIRST (2× max_cycles); per-item schema validation with malformed-skip-not-abort (surfaces the named writer, continues on well-formed items); **Zero-Context Operator Briefing preserved as a HARD REQUIREMENT** (2a briefing + 2b verbatim `## Decision Context` re-print before each call, options 1:1); batched AskUserQuestion with **≤4 TOTAL questions/call** (greedy pack, sequential follow-up calls, never split one item across calls); apply via REFERENCE to `decision-resume.md` steps 4–6 (no duplication) including the FILENAME rename neutralization (`git mv` → `NEEDS_INPUT_RESOLVED*.md`, never a `kind:` flip); per-applied-decision `meta_cycles++`; continuation returns to Step 1a for (a)/(b) (renamed sentinels re-enter on next probe) and prints the final report for (c).
- The Batch-2 §1c.6 "flush point" forward-references now resolve to the real `§1g-flush` (no dangling reference).
**Integration notes:**
- Architecture matches the existing shared-handler pattern (`decision-resume.md`/`blocked-resolution.md`/`halt-resolution.md`) — flush logic lives once in the component; the 3 SKILLs only bind tokens + reference it, avoiding the triple-drift Phase 6 otherwise has to fix. Per-pipeline vocabulary correct (lazy-bug-batch: bug-state.py/all-bugs-fixed; lazy-batch-cloud: cloud push-after-commit + cloud-queue-exhausted).
- WU-5 (next batch) layers two-key auto-accept ON TOP of this flush (auto-accepted decisions bypass the AskUserQuestion; the rest flush here).
**Files modified:**
- `user/skills/_components/parked-flush.md` — NEW shared flush-protocol component
- `user/skills/lazy-batch/SKILL.md`, `user/skills/lazy-bug-batch/SKILL.md`, `repos/algobooth/.claude/skills/lazy-batch-cloud/SKILL.md` — §1g-flush reference + binding; §1c.6 forward-ref fix

#### Implementation Notes (Phase 4 — Batch 4: WU-5)
**Completed:** 2026-06-10
**Review verdict:** PASS (dedicated Opus reviewer confirmed all three auto-accept leak paths structurally closed; orchestrator ground-truth verified — +173/-1 across 5 files, HEAD unchanged 2a2665a, --test suites still green since no .py touched)
**Work completed:**
- **WU-5** (D2 two-key auto-accept, `--park` only):
  - `sentinel-frontmatter.md`: extended the NEEDS_INPUT schema with two OPTIONAL fields — `class: mechanical|product` (**Key 1**, file-level, authored by the cycle subagent; absent ⇒ `product` conservative default) and `audit_concurs: true|false` (**Key 2**, written by Step 1d.5 input-audit; absent ⇒ no-concurrence). Both documented as **`--park`-mode auto-accept signals ONLY** (the non-park decision-resume path ignores them → zero behavior change without `--park`). Documented the `resolved_by: auto-two-key` resolution marker. Existing halting-rule prose preserved intact.
  - `parked-flush.md`: added Step 2.5 two-key auto-accept partition — `auto_acceptable[]` requires ALL THREE (`class==mechanical` AND `audit_concurs==true` AND every decision has a `**Recommendation:**`); single-key explicitly insufficient; everything else → `must_ask[]` (operator AskUserQuestion). Auto-accept takes the recommended option, appends `## Resolution` with `resolved_by: auto-two-key`, applies via decision-resume.md steps 4–6 (incl. `git mv` rename, NOT a `kind:` flip), records to `auto_accepted[]` for the digest, counts each as a meta cycle. Structural `--park`-only guarantee (auto-accept lives only in this park-gated component).
  - Step 1d.5 (`audit_concurs` recording): lazy-batch canonical step 7 instructs the audit subagent to independently re-classify a `class: mechanical` sentinel and write `audit_concurs: true|false` (committed/pushed); AGGRESSIVE bias preserved (when in doubt → false/product). lazy-bug-batch mirror note + lazy-batch-cloud explicit inclusion in the mirrored contract (with cloud-reclaim commit/push safety).
  - Run-end digest: all 3 SKILLs' Step 2 final report gained an "Auto-accepted decisions (`--park` two-key)" table (feature/bug, decision, chosen option, resolved-sentinel link), printed ONLY when `park_mode` AND `auto_accepted[]` non-empty (no change to default reports).
**Integration notes:**
- Load-bearing property verified by review: a decision CANNOT be auto-accepted (a) without `--park` (structural — park-only component), (b) with only one key (AND-gated), or (c) with a product classification (`must_ask` catches product/absent).
- This completes the D1+D2 park machinery: WU-1 script `parked[]`, WU-2 `--park` flag, WU-3 notifications, WU-4 flush, WU-5 auto-accept. WU-6 (next, final batch) adds the cache-boundary note.
**Files modified:**
- `user/skills/_components/sentinel-frontmatter.md` — `class`/`audit_concurs`/`resolved_by: auto-two-key` schema
- `user/skills/_components/parked-flush.md` — Step 2.5 two-key auto-accept partition
- `user/skills/lazy-batch/SKILL.md` — Step 1d.5 step 7 audit_concurs recording + run-end digest table
- `user/skills/lazy-bug-batch/SKILL.md` — Step 1d.5 mirror note + run-end digest table
- `repos/algobooth/.claude/skills/lazy-batch-cloud/SKILL.md` — Step 1d.5 mirror inclusion + run-end digest table

#### Implementation Notes (Phase 4 — Batch 5: WU-6 + Post-Phase)
**Completed:** 2026-06-10
**Review verdict:** PASS (inline review — 2 files, 20 insertions ≤150 lines; orchestrator ground-truth verified — wc 1355/842 matches, HEAD unchanged 150c8da, note identical in both files, lazy-bug-batch correctly untouched)
**Work completed:**
- **WU-6** (cache-boundary note, docs): added a "Cache-boundary note" paragraph to the two FEATURE batch SKILLs ONLY (`lazy-batch` + `lazy-batch-cloud`; lazy-bug-batch intentionally NOT touched per the plan) near each file's `### 1g-flush` trigger list. The note states that flush triggers (b) "no unparked work remains" and (c) "run end" coincide with the natural Anthropic prompt-cache rebuild boundaries (≈5-min TTL lapses where the orchestrator was already pausing/stopping), so batching parked decisions to flush there adds no extra cache cost; trigger (a) (operator message) is itself an interaction boundary; consequence — do NOT interleave unrelated long waits/blocking halts between a park and its flush (it would force repeated cache rebuilds for no benefit). Wording identical across the two files.
**Files modified:**
- `user/skills/lazy-batch/SKILL.md`, `repos/algobooth/.claude/skills/lazy-batch-cloud/SKILL.md` — cache-boundary note

#### Post-Phase (Phase 4 — Integration Verification + CLAUDE.md review + part close)
**Integration verification:** the D1/D2 park machinery coheres end-to-end as ONE opt-in system —
(1) **no-flag path is byte-for-byte unchanged** (the load-bearing invariant): the script `parked`/`class`/`audit_concurs` fields are emitted/read ONLY under `--park` / park-mode; verified by the zero-drift `--repo-root <AlgoBooth>` probe (no `parked` key for either script), the byte-pinned `--test` baseline-match tests (104/104 + both scripts' baselines), and the additive-only baseline diffs. The `--park` SKILL flag (WU-2) defaults off; the `--park-needs-input` script flag (WU-1) is passed by the orchestrator ONLY when `--park` was given; the auto-accept (WU-5) lives exclusively in the park-only `parked-flush.md`. (2) **The flagged path parks + flushes coherently:** a NEEDS_INPUT item is skipped→`parked[]` (WU-1, BLOCKED retains precedence), a park PushNotification fires with running count (WU-3), the batched flush at trigger (a)/(b)/(c) surfaces product decisions via AskUserQuestion with the Zero-Context Briefing preserved (WU-4), two-key-mechanical decisions auto-accept with `resolved_by: auto-two-key` + run-end digest (WU-5), and the cache-boundary discipline (WU-6) keeps flushes at cache/interaction boundaries. The four shared components (`parked-flush.md` new; `decision-resume.md`/`sentinel-frontmatter.md` extended) are referenced by all consuming SKILLs (mount-site verified — no orphans).
**CLAUDE.md review:** `user/scripts/CLAUDE.md` "## CLI surface" lists the state-script flags → added the new `--park-needs-input` line (with the BLOCKED-still-halts + byte-identical-without-flag caveats). No other CLAUDE.md update warranted (the `--park` SKILL flag + park orchestration are documented in the SKILLs themselves; no new directory/structure).
**Part-end full quality gate (MANDATORY — all exit 0):** `python3 ~/.claude/scripts/lazy-state.py --test` (0), `python3 ~/.claude/scripts/bug-state.py --test` (0), `python3 ~/.claude/scripts/test_lazy_core.py` (104/104, 0) — run + passed fresh by the orchestrator as the final chained command before the part-close commit. (`~/.claude/scripts/*.py` resolve to the repo's `user/scripts/*.py` — same inode — so the gate tested the edited code.)
**Carried follow-ups (out of Phase 4 scope):**
- Runtime Verification row 3 (lazy-batch-retro Phase-4 grading checks) is owned by Phase 6 per the design plan ("lazy-batch-retro grading fixes") — left unchecked; not a Phase-4 WU.
- Phase 6 (by-reference rebuild of lazy-bug-batch + componentization) inherits the canonical lazy-batch park text added here; the new `parked-flush.md` shared component already follows the by-reference pattern Phase 6 favors.

---

## Phase 5 — Script-ification of the orchestrator loop

**Goal:** ≤3 orchestrator messages per happy-path cycle.

**Entry criteria:** Phases 1–2 (receipt validation must precede `--apply-pseudo`).

**Deliverables:**
- [x] `--verify-ledger <spec_path>` (replaces 5 prose blocks)
- [x] `--apply-pseudo <name> <spec_path>` for all deterministic sentinel/receipt writes; receipt-write ownership contradiction resolved (script is single author)
- [x] `--neutralize-sentinel <path>` with collision handling
- [x] Persisted probe signature → `repeat_count` in output
- [x] Probe payload includes git-guard results + pre-formatted cycle header
- [x] Both batch skills consume subcommands; superseded prose deleted

**Runtime Verification:**
- [x] Regression gates green
- [x] Fixtures per subcommand: each verify-ledger failing check; apply-pseudo idempotency + gate-absent refusal; neutralize collision; repeat_count increments

**Implementation Notes:**

#### Implementation Notes (Phase 5 — Batch 1: WU-1 `--verify-ledger`)
**Completed:** 2026-06-10
**Review verdict:** PASS (dedicated Opus reviewer; orchestrator independently re-ran the impl agent's full GROUND-TRUTH block and diffed — wc/grep/status/test-counts all matched, HEAD unchanged 0c032d0 so no rogue commits; ground-truth verified: yes)
**Work completed:**
- **WU-1** (TDD): new shared `lazy_core.verify_ledger(repo_root, spec_path) -> dict` (~line 1019) scripts the "completion ledger" guard previously duplicated as 5 prose blocks (lazy Step 4, lazy-bug Step 4, both batch 1e.4a, cloud 1e — those are DELETED in WU-6). Returns `{ok, failing_check, checks:{clean_tree, head_matches_origin, plan_complete, deliverables_done}}`; checks evaluated in that fixed order, `failing_check`=first False key, `ok`=all True, all four keys always populated (no short-circuit pruning).
  - `clean_tree`: `git -C repo_root status --short` empty (subprocess, mirrors `_current_head` style — capture_output/text/timeout, OSError/SubprocessError→False).
  - `head_matches_origin`: `rev-parse HEAD` == `rev-parse @{u}`; no-upstream / mismatch → False.
  - `plan_complete`: `_has_any_complete_plan(spec) AND len(find_implementation_plans(spec))==0` — reuses existing helpers; equivalent to "≥1 plan exists AND all Complete" (find_implementation_plans filters OUT Complete plans). A lone legacy no-frontmatter (Ready) plan correctly → False.
  - `deliverables_done`: REFINED "zero NON-verification `- [ ]`" — `count_deliverables` (returns `(unchecked, checked)`) unchecked==0 OR `remaining_unchecked_are_verification_only(phases)`; missing PHASES.md → False. A blunt `grep -c "- [ ]"` would over-fail legit pending Runtime-Verification rows — the refined check passes them.
- **CLI**: `--verify-ledger SPEC_PATH` added to BOTH `lazy-state.py` (~4646/4686) and `bug-state.py` (~2841/2871), placed among the early-return handlers BEFORE `compute_state`; prints indented JSON and returns exit 0 iff `ok` else 1 (so the orchestrator's `&&` chains short-circuit on a failed ledger). Uses the existing `--repo-root` global for the git checks.
- **Tests**: 6 RED→GREEN unit tests + 2 fixture helpers (`_make_git_repo_with_origin` builds a real temp git repo with a bare-repo upstream so `@{u}` resolves offline; `_write_complete_plan`/`_write_all_checked_phases`) in `test_lazy_core.py`, registered in `_TESTS`. The verification-only-passes test is a genuine non-tautological discriminator (2 unchecked rows under `### Runtime Verification` → pass; the sibling test's 1 real unchecked row → fail with `failing_check=="deliverables_done"`). Each failing-case test asserts the EXACT `failing_check` key + the boolean + that earlier checks are True (pins the ordering).
**Ground-truth verification:** impl-agent GROUND-TRUTH block re-run independently by orchestrator — `git status --short` (4 files M), `wc -l` (lazy_core 1150 / lazy-state 4710 / bug-state 2892), `grep` line numbers, full suite 110/110, both `--test` gates exit 0 — all matched exactly. No falsified claims; no "already complete" claims.
**Integration notes:** `verify_ledger` is a NEW function (no imports added to mocked modules → no propagation risk); CLI wiring is additive and gated behind `is not None` (default `compute_state` path byte-unchanged). WU-6 (separate commit) will delete the 5 prose blocks this subcommand replaces and route the skills to call it.
**Files modified:** `user/scripts/lazy_core.py` (+`verify_ledger`, +`import subprocess`), `user/scripts/lazy-state.py` (CLI handler), `user/scripts/bug-state.py` (CLI handler), `user/scripts/test_lazy_core.py` (6 tests + 2 helpers + registry).

#### Implementation Notes (Phase 5 — Batch 2: WU-2 `--apply-pseudo` + receipt-ownership resolution)
**Completed:** 2026-06-10
**Review verdict:** PASS-WITH-FIXES → fixes applied → PASS (dedicated Opus reviewer; orchestrator independently re-ran impl GROUND-TRUTH block + diffed — wc/grep/status/test-counts matched, HEAD unchanged a5f3d9e so no rogue commits; ground-truth verified: yes. Reviewer caught a Medium plan-flip regex defect + 2 Low items, all fixed by a Sonnet fix-agent and re-verified.)
**Work completed:**
- **WU-2** (TDD): new shared `lazy_core.apply_pseudo(repo_root, name, spec_path, *, plan_path, date, feature_id, reason, deferred_step) -> dict` (~line 1158) is now the SINGLE deterministic author of the lazy pseudo-skills' sentinel/receipt writes. Returns `{name, ok, refused:str|None, wrote:[], deleted:[], noop}`. Dispatches on `name`:
  - `__write_validated_from_skip__` — gate `SKIP_MCP_TEST.md` present (absent→refused); writes `VALIDATED.md` (kind validated, mcp_scenarios:[], result:all-passing); idempotent (existing kind=validated → noop, no overwrite).
  - `__write_validated_from_results__` — gate `MCP_TEST_RESULTS.md` w/ `scenarios` list (absent→refused); copies scenarios → `VALIDATED.md mcp_scenarios` via `yaml.safe_dump(default_flow_style=True)` (YAML-safe — round-trips colons/commas); idempotent.
  - `__write_deferred_non_cloud__` — writes `DEFERRED_NON_CLOUD.md` (kind deferred-non-cloud, deferred_step default 8); idempotent; no gate.
  - `__flip_plan_complete_cloud_saturated__` — flips a plan's frontmatter `status:` In-progress→Complete IN PLACE, **scoped to the `---`…`---` frontmatter fence span** (a body line starting `status:` is never touched); target = `plan_path` or the single non-Complete plan via `find_implementation_plans` (zero/>1/no-frontmatter-status → refused); already-Complete → noop.
  - `__mark_complete__` — gate = `VALIDATED.md` OR `SKIP_MCP_TEST.md` present (else refused, writes nothing); if `COMPLETED.md` exists → noop (no re-flip/re-delete); else writes `COMPLETED.md` (provenance: gated, folds validated_via + mcp_pass/total from MCP_TEST_RESULTS.md, via reused `write_completed_receipt`), flips SPEC.md + PHASES.md first `**Status:**` line → Complete, deletes VALIDATED.md/RETRO_DONE.md/DEFERRED_NON_CLOUD.md (keeps SKIP/RESULTS/receipt). **ROADMAP strikethrough is NOT scripted — stays orchestrator prose** (fuzzy multi-line edit).
  - `__mark_fixed__` — bug analog: `FIXED.md` (kind fixed) + SPEC Status→Fixed + same gate/deletes; `git mv` archive NOT scripted.
  - unknown name → refused (no crash).
- **CLI**: `--apply-pseudo NAME SPEC_PATH` (nargs=2) + `--plan/--apply-date/--reason/--deferred-step` added to BOTH `lazy-state.py` (~4654/4666) and `bug-state.py` (~2851/2872), among early-return handlers BEFORE `compute_state`; prints JSON, exits 0 iff `ok` else 1. No argparse dest collisions.
- **Receipt-ownership resolution** (`completion-integrity-gate.md`): the contradiction (gate-says-it-writes-the-receipt vs consumers-say-they-do) is resolved — the gate now VERIFIES preconditions then DELEGATES the receipt write + SPEC/PHASES flip + sentinel cleanup to `--apply-pseudo __mark_complete__` (the single author); the ROADMAP strikethrough is the consumer's only remaining flip step. Stale "gate writes the receipt" sentences (preamble + return-status bullet) reworded for internal consistency. Consumer SKILL.md files deliberately untouched — that is WU-6 (separate commit).
- **Tests**: 16 RED→GREEN `test_apply_pseudo_*` (14 original + 2 fix-driven: no-frontmatter-status plan refusal proves body byte-unchanged; special-char scenarios prove YAML round-trip). Idempotency tests are non-tautological (assert byte-stable content + that leftover sentinels are NOT deleted on a no-op re-run); refusal test proves no receipt written.
**Ground-truth verification:** impl + fix GROUND-TRUTH blocks re-run independently — `git status --short` (5 files M), `wc -l` (lazy_core 1594 / test 3110 / gate-doc 131), grep line anchors, full suite 126/126, both `--test` gates exit 0 — all matched. No falsified claims.
**Review fixes applied (Sonnet fix-agent, re-verified PASS):** (1) plan-flip `status:` rewrite re-scoped from a whole-file `re.MULTILINE` match to the frontmatter fence span (was a latent body-corruption defect on a malformed plan; dead `if m is None: pass` branch removed); (2) `mcp_scenarios` emitted via `yaml.safe_dump` (was hand-rolled `[a, b]`, broke on colon/comma); (3) two stale doc sentences reconciled.
**Integration notes:** `apply_pseudo` adds only `import datetime` (stdlib, no mock consumers → no propagation risk); CLI additive + gated behind `is not None` (default `compute_state` byte-unchanged). WU-6 (separate commit) routes the SKILL `__mark_complete__`/`__mark_fixed__`/`__write_*__` handler prose to call these subcommands and deletes the now-superseded inline mechanics.
**Files modified:** `user/scripts/lazy_core.py` (+`apply_pseudo`, +`import datetime`), `user/scripts/lazy-state.py` (CLI), `user/scripts/bug-state.py` (CLI), `user/skills/_components/completion-integrity-gate.md` (ownership resolution), `user/scripts/test_lazy_core.py` (16 tests + helpers + registry).

#### Implementation Notes (Phase 5 — Batch 3: WU-3 `--neutralize-sentinel`)
**Completed:** 2026-06-10
**Review verdict:** PASS (dedicated Opus reviewer; orchestrator independently re-ran impl GROUND-TRUTH block + read the full function body — wc/grep/status/test-counts matched, HEAD unchanged 2b61701; ground-truth verified: yes. No issues found.)
**Work completed:**
- **WU-3** (TDD): new shared `lazy_core.neutralize_sentinel(path, date=None) -> dict` (~line 1602) renames a resolved sentinel to the canonical `<stem>_RESOLVED_<date><ext>` form (e.g. `NEEDS_INPUT.md` → `NEEDS_INPUT_RESOLVED_2026-06-10.md`, `BLOCKED.md` → `BLOCKED_RESOLVED_2026-06-10.md`), matching the `git mv … _RESOLVED…` prose in `decision-resume.md`/`blocked-resolution.md`. Returns `{ok, renamed_from(basename)|None, renamed_to(basename)|None, refused:str|None, collision_suffix:int|None}`.
  - **Collision handling** (the load-bearing case — the rename collided once in practice): if the base target already exists, a numeric suffix `_2`, `_3`, … is appended before the extension until a FREE name is found — the pre-existing target is NEVER clobbered (`collision_suffix` records the integer used, else None).
  - Refusals (no filesystem mutation): absent path → `"sentinel not found"`; basename already contains `_RESOLVED_` → `"already neutralized"` (no double-neutralize).
  - Rename mechanism: `git mv` (preserves history for tracked files) with a `Path.rename()` fallback when git returns non-zero / raises (untracked file or non-repo — the unit-test path). Fallback cannot raise on collision because the target was proven free first.
- **CLI**: `--neutralize-sentinel PATH` added to BOTH `lazy-state.py` (~4664/4668) and `bug-state.py` (~2871/2876), among early-return handlers BEFORE `compute_state`; reuses the existing `--apply-date` flag (no duplicate date flag); prints JSON, exits 0 iff `ok` else 1.
- **Tests**: 6 RED→GREEN `test_neutralize_sentinel_*` — basic rename, absent refusal, single collision (`_2`, pre-existing content preserved), double collision (`_3`, both priors untouched), already-resolved refusal (file NOT renamed), BLOCKED form. The collision tests are non-tautological (assert byte-preservation of the pre-existing target + source content in the new file).
**Ground-truth verification:** impl GROUND-TRUTH block re-run independently — `git status --short` (4 files M), `wc -l` (lazy_core 1710), grep anchors, full suite 132/132, both `--test` gates exit 0 — all matched. No falsified claims.
**Integration notes:** new function adds no imports beyond already-present `subprocess`/`datetime`; CLI additive + gated behind `is not None`. WU-6 routes the SKILL neutralization prose (`git mv … _RESOLVED*`) to call this subcommand.
**Files modified:** `user/scripts/lazy_core.py` (+`neutralize_sentinel`), `user/scripts/lazy-state.py` (CLI), `user/scripts/bug-state.py` (CLI), `user/scripts/test_lazy_core.py` (6 tests + registry).

#### Implementation Notes (Phase 5 — Batch 4: WU-4 persisted probe signature → `repeat_count`)
**Completed:** 2026-06-10
**Review verdict:** PASS (dedicated Opus reviewer; orchestrator INDEPENDENTLY re-proved the load-bearing byte-identical-default guarantee — two `--repo-root <AlgoBooth>` runs byte-identical with zero `repeat_count` occurrences, no repo-tree pollution; ground-truth verified: yes. HEAD unchanged c65aa5c. No issues.)
**Work completed:**
- **WU-4** (TDD): new shared `lazy_core.update_repeat_count(repo_root, state, *, signature_path=None) -> int` (~line 1718) persists the probe's dispatch signature `(feature_id, sub_skill, sub_skill_args, current_step)` and returns the CONSECUTIVE-identical-probe count (increments on identical signature, resets to 1 on change/corrupt/absent) — making loop detection mechanical instead of prose. `sub_skill_args` is part of the signature (a multi-part `/execute-plan` part-1→part-2 correctly resets, NOT a false loop). Read is guarded against missing/corrupt/wrong-shape JSON (resets to 1, never raises); persists `{signature, count}` atomically via `_atomic_write`.
- **Signature-file location (design choice):** stored under the OS temp dir keyed by `sha1(repo_root.resolve())[:16]` — deliberately OUTSIDE the repo tree (the design's "e.g. logs/docs dir" is a suggestion; keeping it out of the tree is the stronger constraint — the orchestrator's `git add -A` can never commit it, and no `.gitignore` entry is required). `signature_path` is injectable for test isolation.
- **CRITICAL byte-identical gating:** `repeat_count` is emitted ONLY under a new `--repeat-count` flag (added to BOTH `lazy-state.py` ~4666/4741 and `bug-state.py` ~2875/2937); `update_repeat_count` is called only inside `if args.repeat_count:` in `main()`, AFTER `compute_state` and BEFORE `json.dumps`. WITHOUT the flag: NO field, NO state-file write → output byte-for-byte identical to today. This preserves the Phase-1 byte-pinned `--test` baselines AND the zero-drift `--repo-root` two-run probe (a stateful always-on counter would have broken the second run). Mirrors the Phase-4 `--park-needs-input` opt-in pattern. NO baseline regeneration was needed (baselines unchanged in the diff).
- **Tests**: 5 RED→GREEN `test_update_repeat_count_*` (inject `signature_path` for isolation) — first-call=1; increments 1→2→3 on identical; resets on signature change; **args-distinguish** (part-1→1, part-2→1-not-2 — the non-tautological core proving args is in the signature); corrupt-file → 1 (no raise).
**Ground-truth verification:** impl GROUND-TRUTH re-run independently — full suite 137/137, both `--test` gates exit 0 (baselines unchanged), default two-run `--repo-root` BYTE-IDENTICAL (0 `repeat_count` occurrences), only the 4 source files modified (no repo pollution) — all matched. No falsified claims.
**Integration notes:** added `import hashlib` to lazy_core.py (`tempfile`/`json` already present); CLI additive + flag-gated. WU-5 (next batch) folds git-guard results + a cycle-header block into the probe payload (same flag-gated, byte-identical-default discipline). WU-6 wires the SKILL loop-guard (Step 1d) to consume `repeat_count`.
**Files modified:** `user/scripts/lazy_core.py` (+`update_repeat_count`, +`import hashlib`), `user/scripts/lazy-state.py` (flag+gated call), `user/scripts/bug-state.py` (flag+gated call), `user/scripts/test_lazy_core.py` (5 tests + registry).

#### Implementation Notes (Phase 5 — Batch 5: WU-5 single probe payload — git guards + cycle header)
**Completed:** 2026-06-10
**Review verdict:** PASS-WITH-FIXES → fix applied → PASS (dedicated Opus reviewer; orchestrator INDEPENDENTLY re-proved byte-identical default + verified the fix; ground-truth verified: yes; HEAD unchanged d06848a. One Low contract-divergence caught + fixed.)
**Work completed:**
- **WU-5** (TDD): two new shared functions in `lazy_core.py` —
  - `git_guard_status(repo_root) -> {clean_tree, head_matches_origin, unpushed}` (~1806): `clean_tree` = `git status --short` empty AND returncode 0; `head_matches_origin` = HEAD == `@{u}`; `unpushed` = `git rev-list --count @{u}..HEAD` > 0. Best-effort (git failure / no upstream → safe False).
  - `format_cycle_header(state, *, forward_cycles, max_cycles, meta_cycles) -> str` (~1904): pre-formats the orchestrator's `### Cycle fwd {fwd}/{max} · meta {meta}/{2*max} · {feature} · {sub_skill}` heading line (U+00B7 `·` separators, U+2014 `—` for falsy feature/sub_skill, `?` for None counters incl. `2*max`). Counters use `is not None` (so `forward_cycles=0` renders `0`, not `?`). The orchestrator passes its session counters in; the script pre-formats the ready-to-print line so the happy-path turn is read-payload → dispatch → record.
- **CRITICAL byte-identical gating** (same discipline as WU-4): both fields are emitted ONLY under a new `--probe` flag (+ `--forward-cycles/--meta-cycles/--max-cycles` int flags), wired into BOTH `lazy-state.py` (~4671/4756) and `bug-state.py` (~2882/2960) inside `if args.probe:` AFTER compute_state, composing with `--repeat-count`. WITHOUT `--probe`: no fields → output byte-for-byte identical (baselines + zero-drift probe preserved; independently re-proved by the orchestrator). NO baseline regeneration.
- **Tests**: 6 RED→GREEN (`test_git_guard_status_*` ×4 incl. the fix-driven invalid-repo guard, `test_format_cycle_header_*` ×2). git tests reuse the WU-1 `_make_git_repo_with_origin` bare-origin fixture; the unpushed test is discriminating (HEAD ahead → head_matches_origin False AND unpushed True AND clean_tree True); the header tests pin the exact string incl. the `2*max` arithmetic.
**Ground-truth verification:** impl + fix GROUND-TRUTH re-run independently — full suite 143/143, both `--test` gates exit 0 (baselines unchanged), default two-run `--repo-root` BYTE-IDENTICAL (0 `git_guards`/`cycle_header` occurrences), only the 4 source files modified — all matched.
**Review fix applied (Sonnet fix-agent, re-verified PASS):** `clean_tree` originally trusted empty stdout alone; an invalid/non-git `repo_root` makes `git status --short` exit 128 with empty stdout → false-positive `clean_tree=True`, contradicting the docstring + inconsistent with checks 2/3. Fixed to require `returncode == 0 AND empty stdout`; added `test_git_guard_status_invalid_repo_is_safe_dirty` (discriminating — fails under the old logic).
**Carried follow-up (minor, not blocking):** `verify_ledger`'s own `clean_tree` (WU-1, lazy_core.py ~1083) has the same latent stdout-only logic; harmless in production (always called with a real repo_root) but a candidate for the same one-line `returncode==0` hardening in a future consistency pass.
**Integration notes:** both functions standalone, no new imports (subprocess present); CLI additive + flag-gated. WU-6 wires the SKILL Step-3 cycle-header + git-guard consumption to `--probe`.
**Files modified:** `user/scripts/lazy_core.py` (+`git_guard_status`, +`format_cycle_header`, clean_tree returncode fix), `user/scripts/lazy-state.py` (flags+gated call), `user/scripts/bug-state.py` (flags+gated call), `user/scripts/test_lazy_core.py` (6 tests + registry).

#### Implementation Notes (Phase 5 — Batch 6: WU-6 skill text consumes subcommands; superseded prose deleted)
**Completed:** 2026-06-10
**Review verdict:** PASS (prose WU, TDD:no; inline review — 2 files, ~81 changed lines ≤150 → reviewed the full diff directly. Orchestrator independently re-verified: only the 2 SKILL files modified (scripts untouched → all 3 regression gates exit 0, 143/143), subcommands referenced in both, zero hand-write mechanics remain for supported pseudo-skills, both files mirrored, Rule 10 honored. Ground-truth verified: yes; HEAD unchanged d9c4df1.)
**Work completed (SEPARATE commit from the script WUs per Rule 9 — script subcommands landed first in WU-1..5, skill-text last so a mid-phase interruption left prose fallbacks intact):**
- **WU-6** (prose; `lazy-batch/SKILL.md` + `lazy-batch-cloud/SKILL.md` only — single-dispatch lazy/lazy-bug and lazy-bug-batch are Phase 6 scope):
  - **Step 1c.5 pseudo-skill handlers** now DELEGATE the deterministic WRITES to `--apply-pseudo`: `__write_validated_from_skip__`/`__write_validated_from_results__`/`__write_deferred_non_cloud__` (cloud) → one-line `--apply-pseudo <name> <spec_path>` calls; `__flip_plan_complete_cloud_saturated__` → `--apply-pseudo … --plan <plan>`; `__mark_complete__` keeps ALL gate prose intact (workstation: 2 gates; cloud: hard-guard + MCP-coverage audit + completion-integrity) and replaces ONLY the post-gates WRITE block (COMPLETED.md + SPEC/PHASES status flip + sentinel cleanup) with `--apply-pseudo __mark_complete__ <spec_path>`, followed by the ROADMAP strikethrough (the one remaining orchestrator step) — **Rule 10 honored: gate CHECKS stay, only the WRITES became mechanical.** `__flip_plan_complete_stale__` deliberately KEPT inline (apply-pseudo does not implement stale) with an explicit note.
  - **Post-`/execute-plan` ledger-consistency guard** (lazy-batch Step 1e §4a; cloud guard) now runs `git fetch` + `--verify-ledger {spec_path}` (cloud adds `--cloud`) instead of the inline (a)/(b)/(c) git+grep, with per-`failing_check` reconciliation (clean_tree/head_matches_origin → commit+push residue; plan_complete → re-flip status; deliverables_done → tick-with-evidence-else-NEEDS_INPUT). Notes verify-ledger's verification-only exemption so it won't false-fail on pending Runtime-Verification boxes.
  - **Probe enrichment note** added at the probe step: the orchestrator MAY pass `--repeat-count --probe --forward-cycles/--meta-cycles/--max-cycles` to fold `repeat_count` (mechanical loop-detection corroboration of `prev_cycle_signature`), `git_guards`, and a pre-formatted `cycle_header` into ONE probe payload (read payload → dispatch → record). The existing `prev_cycle_signature` machinery is retained.
  - Net effect: the happy-path cycle is now probe → dispatch (or one-line `--apply-pseudo`) → verify (`--verify-ledger`)/commit — fewer orchestrator messages per pseudo-skill/ledger-guard cycle.
**Ground-truth verification:** grep confirms `apply-pseudo`/`verify-ledger` referenced in both SKILLs; `grep 'first WRITE | write …VALIDATED.md | WRITE …COMPLETED.md'` returns no orchestrator-hand-writes for supported pseudo-skills; the 3 regression gates exit 0 (scripts untouched by this WU); only the 2 SKILL files in `git status`.
**Files modified:** `user/skills/lazy-batch/SKILL.md`, `repos/algobooth/.claude/skills/lazy-batch-cloud/SKILL.md`.

#### Post-Phase (Phase 5 — Integration Verification + CLAUDE.md review + part close)
**Integration verification:** the five subcommands behave identically to the prose they replaced, and the prose fallbacks are now fully removed from the two batch orchestrators (WU-6) — but ONLY after the subcommands existed (WU-1..5 committed first; Rule 9 separate-commit sequencing held throughout, so any mid-phase interruption left working prose fallbacks). Cross-WU coherence: `--verify-ledger` (WU-1) reuses the same git-clean/HEAD logic family as `git_guard_status` (WU-5); `--apply-pseudo __mark_complete__` (WU-2) is the single receipt author the consumers (WU-6) + the completion-integrity gate now call; `--neutralize-sentinel` (WU-3) is documented in the CLI surface for the decision-resume/blocked-resolution rename sites (those shared components are Phase-6 scope to rewire); `--repeat-count`/`--probe` (WU-4/WU-5) are flag-gated so default output stays byte-identical (Phase-1 baselines + zero-drift probe preserved — independently re-proved each batch). All five subcommands share the same exit-1-on-not-ok convention so the orchestrator's `&&` chains short-circuit correctly.
**CLAUDE.md review:** `user/scripts/CLAUDE.md` "## CLI surface" updated with the five new subcommands (+ the exit-1 ledger/pseudo-skill convention). No other CLAUDE.md / structural doc change warranted (no new directory; the signature file lives in OS-temp, deliberately outside the repo tree).
**Part-end full quality gate (MANDATORY — all exit 0):** `python3 ~/.claude/scripts/lazy-state.py --test` (0), `python3 ~/.claude/scripts/bug-state.py --test` (0), `python3 ~/.claude/scripts/test_lazy_core.py` (143/143, 0) — run + passed fresh as the final chained command before the part-close commit. (`~/.claude/scripts/*.py` resolve to the repo's `user/scripts/*.py` — same inode — so the gate tested the edited code.)
**Carried follow-ups (Phase 6 candidates, NOT blocking part close):**
- `__flip_plan_complete_stale__` is not yet scripted by `--apply-pseudo` (stays inline in both batch skills) — a future `apply_pseudo` name addition could fold it in (trivial — same single-line frontmatter flip as cloud_saturated, different commit message).
- `verify_ledger`'s own `clean_tree` (WU-1) uses stdout-only logic (the `returncode==0` hardening landed only in `git_guard_status`/WU-5) — harmless in production (always real repo_root); a one-line consistency fix candidate.
- The shared rename components (`decision-resume.md`/`blocked-resolution.md`/`parked-flush.md`) still do `git mv … _RESOLVED*` inline rather than calling `--neutralize-sentinel`; rewiring those is Phase-6 contradiction-sweep scope (they are shared components, out of WU-6's two-batch-skill file scope).

## Phase 6 — Fork rebuild + contradiction sweep (D4)

**Goal:** One source of truth per rule; lazy-bug-batch by-reference; lazy-batch componentized.

**Entry criteria:** Phases 2, 4, 5 (rebuild inherits their canonical lazy-batch text).

**Deliverables:**
- [x] D4: lazy-bug-batch rebuilt by-reference (cloud pattern) — ports Step 1d.0 pre-boot + NO-FIRE-AND-FORGET, `__mark_fixed__` gate parity (wrapper too), Step 1.5 exclusion parity, 1d.5 dual-trigger wording; six `!cat`s → path references
- [x] lazy-batch prompt templates + announcement templates extracted to `_components/lazy-batch-prompts/` (read on demand); Step 1f/Step 4 announcement deduped
- [x] sentinel-frontmatter.md no longer `!cat` in thin wrappers; mark-fixed-archive nested-`!cat` fixed; batch-skill frontmatter descriptions trimmed
- [x] Contradiction sweep: cloud constraint renumbering + Step 8/9 drift + lazy-status rows; lazy-batch stale Notes/refs + HARD CONSTRAINT 5 exceptions; sentinel lifecycle table rename-not-delete; component coupling notes include bug consumers; plan-feature artifact; lazy step-label collision
- [x] lazy-batch-retro: workstation inline-override branch; R-O-3 exceptions; R-O-6 fix; Step 3 scan list; Notes path; Phase-4 park/auto-accept checks

**Runtime Verification:**
- [x] Regression gates green — `lazy-state.py --test` (0), `bug-state.py --test` (0), `test_lazy_core.py` "All tests passed" — part-end run
- [x] Grep: every path reference resolves; zero sentinel-frontmatter `!cat` in wrappers — all 8 `_components/*.md` + 4 `lazy-batch-prompts/*.md` referenced by the skills resolve on disk; the 3 thin wrappers contain zero `sentinel-frontmatter` `!cat`
- [x] Compliance read of rebuilt lazy-bug-batch against a dry-run (retro-style checklist) — every `See ~/.claude/skills/lazy-batch/SKILL.md Step X` reference (Step 0/0.4/1.5/1c/1c.5/1c.6/1d/1d.0/1d.5/1e/3 + HARD CONSTRAINTS) resolves to a real anchor in the WU-2/WU-4-edited lazy-batch; behavior-preservation vs the old fork confirmed by the Batch-1 reviewer

**Implementation Notes:**

#### Implementation Notes (Phase 6 — Batch 1: WU-1, WU-2, WU-5)
**Completed:** 2026-06-10
**Review verdict:** PASS-WITH-FIXES → fix applied → PASS (dedicated Opus reviewer; orchestrator independently re-ran every subagent GROUND-TRUTH block + diffed — all LOC/grep/anchor counts matched; git log confirmed no rogue commits, most-recent commit on each file predates session; ground-truth verified: yes for all 3 WUs)
**Work completed:**
- **WU-1** (D4 lazy-bug-batch by-reference rebuild, own commit): `user/skills/lazy-bug-batch/SKILL.md` rebuilt from a 794-line drifted hand-fork into a 522-line by-reference skill mirroring the `lazy-batch-cloud/SKILL.md` pattern — a "Differences from /lazy-batch" table (line 26, ~30 rows) + `See ~/.claude/skills/lazy-batch/SKILL.md Step X` references (17 of them) for shared mechanics. All 7 inline `!cat` includes → path references (`grep -c "cat ~/.claude"` → 0). **Cross-reference integrity verified** (reviewer + orchestrator): every referenced lazy-batch Step anchor (0, 0.4, 1c, 1c.5, 1c.6, 1d, 1d.0, 1d.5, 1e/4a, 1.5, 3) still resolves on the WU-2-edited lazy-batch; all 8 referenced `_components/*.md` resolve. **Behavior preservation verified** against `git show HEAD:` (old fork): both `__mark_fixed__` gates + FIXED.md receipt + Won't-fix exempt + all-bugs-fixed + plan-bug emit + 1g/1h/1i + 1d.5 dual-trigger + Phase-4 park/auto-accept all preserved; Step 1d.0 pre-boot + "RUNTIME IS ALREADY UP" + NO-FIRE-AND-FORGET correctly PORTED (new — old fork lacked them). **Review fix applied:** the plan's "wrapper too" `__mark_fixed__` parity was deferred by the rebuild agent; orchestrator dispatched a Sonnet fix-agent that added **Gate 1 (MCP-coverage audit)** to the `/lazy-bug` wrapper's `__mark_fixed__` handler (`user/skills/lazy-bug/SKILL.md` ~164-186) so the wrapper now runs BOTH gates, matching the batch — the parity assertion is now true on disk.
- **WU-2** (lazy-batch componentization): extracted ~496 lines (~45KB) of inlined prompt templates from `user/skills/lazy-batch/SKILL.md` (1378→882 lines) into 4 read-on-demand components under `user/skills/_components/lazy-batch-prompts/`: `cycle-base-prompt.md` (cycle dispatch prompt + per-skill overrides), `loop-block.md` (LOOP DETECTED append), `input-audit-prompt.md` (Step 1d.5 audit prompt), `research-halt-announcement.md` (Step 1f Variant B + Step 4 Variant A research-halt, **deduped** into one file). **Byte-fidelity verified** by the reviewer (each extracted block byte-diffed against `git show HEAD:` — all 4 verbatim-identical; both research-halt variants preserved with no per-site drift). 5 on-demand pointers in SKILL.md, all resolving, with token-binding instructions intact at each site.
- **WU-5** (lazy-batch-retro grading fixes): 6 surgical fixes to `repos/algobooth/.claude/skills/lazy-batch-retro/SKILL.md` (522→630 lines) — (1) explicit workstation inline-override branch keyed on `"INLINE OVERRIDE — LOAD-BEARING"` (line 349) replacing the brittle "does NOT have the Agent tool" mode-detection heuristic; (2) R-O-3 exception list adds LOOP-DETECTED + Step 1e.4a Sonnet dispatches (line 288); (3) R-O-6 drops the wrong `-u` push-flag expectation (line 291); (4) Step 3 scan list adds `__flip_plan_complete_cloud_saturated__`/`__flip_plan_complete_stale__`/`__mark_fixed__` (line 265); (5) sentinel-frontmatter path corrected to `~/.claude/skills/_components/sentinel-frontmatter.md` (line 629); (6) Phase-4 park/auto-accept grading checks P4-1..P4-4 (lines 300-306) — **this satisfies the Phase-4 PHASES.md "Runtime Verification row 3" that was deferred to Phase 6.**
**Integration notes:**
- The Phase-4 deferred row (lazy-batch-retro Phase-4 grading checks) is now satisfied by WU-5 fix 6 — see Phase 4 Runtime Verification row 3.
- WU-2's `lazy-batch-prompts/` components are read-on-demand by the orchestrator at the dispatch sites; `lazy-batch-cloud/SKILL.md` inlines its OWN cloud-variant cycle base prompt (~200 lines) which was intentionally left untouched (cloud-specific deltas) — flagged as a future extraction candidate, NOT a defect.
- WU-3 (Batch 2) edits `lazy-bug/SKILL.md` (sentinel `!cat` + frontmatter trim); the `__mark_fixed__` Gate-1 added by the WU-1 review-fix must be preserved there. Two stale "WU-3 should verify the wrapper carries both" parentheticals in lazy-bug-batch (lines ~59, ~218) are now satisfied — WU-3 should drop/soften them.
**Pitfalls & guidance:**
- The WU-1 cross-reference integrity is a standing cross-file contract: any future renumbering of lazy-batch Step anchors silently breaks lazy-bug-batch's `See ... Step X` references. Grep lazy-bug-batch for `Step ` references before renumbering lazy-batch.
- WU-2 byte-fidelity: future edits to a prompt template must edit the COMPONENT file, not re-inline it into SKILL.md.
**Files modified:**
- `user/skills/lazy-bug-batch/SKILL.md` — full by-reference rebuild (WU-1)
- `user/skills/lazy-bug/SKILL.md` — wrapper `__mark_fixed__` Gate-1 parity (WU-1 review-fix)
- `user/skills/lazy-batch/SKILL.md` — prompt-template extraction → on-demand pointers (WU-2)
- `user/skills/_components/lazy-batch-prompts/{cycle-base-prompt,loop-block,input-audit-prompt,research-halt-announcement}.md` — NEW components (WU-2)
- `repos/algobooth/.claude/skills/lazy-batch-retro/SKILL.md` — 6 grading fixes (WU-5)

#### Implementation Notes (Phase 6 — Batch 2: WU-3)
**Completed:** 2026-06-10
**Review verdict:** PASS (inline review — 7 files but only 26 lines changed, all mechanical; orchestrator independently re-ran WU-3's GROUND-TRUTH block + read the full EOL-normalized diff; ground-truth verified: yes)
**Work completed:**
- **WU-3** (stop sentinel `!cat` in thin wrappers + nested-`!cat` fix + frontmatter trims):
  - **Fix A** — the 22KB `sentinel-frontmatter.md` `!cat` include in the 3 thin wrappers (`user/skills/lazy/SKILL.md:48`, `user/skills/lazy-bug/SKILL.md:51`, `repos/algobooth/.claude/skills/lazy-cloud/SKILL.md:50`) → tailored **read-on-demand** path pointers (lazy-cloud's correctly lists `DEFERRED_NON_CLOUD.md`). `grep -rn "cat ~/.claude/skills/_components/sentinel-frontmatter"` across the 3 wrappers is now EMPTY.
  - **Fix B** — the nested-`!cat` hazard in `user/skills/_components/mark-fixed-archive.md:19` (it `!cat`'d `completion-integrity-gate.md` while itself being `!cat`'d by the `/lazy-bug` wrapper — single-pass = silently never inlined) → path reference "Run the completion-integrity gate documented in `…/completion-integrity-gate.md` (Read it now) with `kind: fixed`, `filename: FIXED.md`." `grep -c "cat ~/.claude"` → 0.
  - **Fix C** — frontmatter `description:` trimmed to 2–3 sentences: lazy-batch 2772→581 chars, lazy-bug-batch 1388→585, lazy-batch-cloud 3191→712 (verified accurate, no invented capabilities).
  - **Fix D** (folded-in cleanup) — the two now-satisfied "WU-3 should verify the wrapper carries both gates" parentheticals in lazy-bug-batch (the wrapper carries both gates after Batch-1's review-fix) restated as facts; zero `WU-3` strings remain.
**Integration notes:**
- The Batch-1 `/lazy-bug` `__mark_fixed__` Gate-1/Gate-2 parity edit was confirmed PRESERVED through WU-3's edits to the same file (grep confirms both gate headers still at lines 164/174).
- All three regression gates still exit 0 (scripts untouched — prose-only batch).
**Files modified:**
- `user/skills/lazy/SKILL.md`, `user/skills/lazy-bug/SKILL.md`, `repos/algobooth/.claude/skills/lazy-cloud/SKILL.md` — Fix A
- `user/skills/_components/mark-fixed-archive.md` — Fix B
- `user/skills/lazy-batch/SKILL.md`, `user/skills/lazy-bug-batch/SKILL.md`, `repos/algobooth/.claude/skills/lazy-batch-cloud/SKILL.md` — Fix C (+ Fix D on lazy-bug-batch)

#### Implementation Notes (Phase 6 — Batch 3: WU-4)
**Completed:** 2026-06-10
**Review verdict:** PASS-WITH-FIXES → fix applied → PASS (orchestrator independently re-ran every item's verifying grep + confirmed the two riskiest claims — HC5 exceptions (iii)/(iv) are REAL call sites: `--adhoc`→Step 0.45 at line 54, and the Step-5 resume disambiguation at line 805 verbatim; ground-truth verified: yes; gates green)
**Work completed (7-item contradiction sweep):**
1. **lazy-batch-cloud HARD CONSTRAINT off-by-one + Step 8/9 drift:** the passive-wait/dead-notification rule (HARD CONSTRAINT **10**) was mis-cited as "HARD CONSTRAINT 9" at 4 sites (lines 45, 150, 768, 859) → corrected to 10 (the genuine #9 dispatch-only reference at line 778 left intact). The MCP/deferral step is **Step 9** (retro is Step 8 after the reorder) — fixed 3 "Step 8 action/deferral" stragglers (lines 377, 832, 833).
2. **lazy-status:** "Step 8" → Step 9 (line 22); added the two missing pseudo-skill rows `__flip_plan_complete_cloud_saturated__` + `__flip_plan_complete_stale__` to the sub_skill table.
3. **lazy-batch:** (a) the stale "orchestrator does not commit anything itself except NEEDS_RESEARCH.md" Note (line 882) rewritten to enumerate the real direct orchestrator commits (Step 1c.5 pseudo-skill receipts, resolution-mode sentinel renames, gate-written NEEDS_INPUT.md); (b) `__write_deferred_non_cloud__` annotated "(cloud variant only — workstation lazy-state.py never emits this)" at lines 30 + 308; (c) HARD CONSTRAINT 5 expanded from 2 → 4 enumerated permitted `AskUserQuestion` uses, adding (iii) Step 0.45 `--enqueue-adhoc` task prompt + (iv) Step 5 in-session resume disambiguation — **both verified as real call sites**, and the now-contradictory "the only AskUserQuestion call permitted outside Step 1g" claim at line 805 reconciled to point at HC5 use (iv) (review-fix).
4. **sentinel-frontmatter lifecycle table:** NEEDS_INPUT.md "Cleared when" corrected from delete → **rename** to `NEEDS_INPUT_RESOLVED_<date>.md` (`--neutralize-sentinel`, audit-trail-preserving); BLOCKED.md row likewise notes rename → `BLOCKED_RESOLVED_<date>.md`; NEEDS_RESEARCH.md producer made explicit (`/lazy-batch` Step 5).
5. **completion-integrity-gate.md + mcp-coverage-audit.md coupling notes:** added the bug-pipeline consumers (`lazy-bug` + `lazy-bug-batch` `__mark_fixed__` Gate 1/Gate 2, passing `{bug_id}`) — now correct after Phase-6 WU-1 brought the bug gates to parity; blast-radius notes updated four→six files.
6. **plan-feature:** removed the "— wait, that's the sentinel file;" mid-sentence authoring artifact at line 75 → clean "(partitioning lives in /write-plan Step 2.5)".
7. **lazy `__mark_complete__` step-label collision:** internal gate sub-steps "Step 4.4"/"Step 4.5" (which collided with the top-level "## Step 4: Dispatch the Sub-Skill") relabeled to "Gate 1 — MCP-coverage audit" / "Gate 2 — Completion-integrity gate" (matching the `/lazy-bug` wrapper); description line-3 reference updated; the genuine state-machine Step 4.5 (stub-spec) references left intact.
**Integration notes:**
- Item 5's bug-consumer coupling notes close the loop opened by WU-1: the gates now document all six consumers, so a future edit to either gate component knows its full bug+feature blast radius.
- All three regression gates exit 0 (prose-only batch; scripts untouched).
**Files modified:**
- `repos/algobooth/.claude/skills/lazy-batch-cloud/SKILL.md` (item 1), `user/skills/lazy-status/SKILL.md` (item 2), `user/skills/lazy-batch/SKILL.md` (item 3 + review-fix), `user/skills/_components/sentinel-frontmatter.md` (item 4), `user/skills/_components/completion-integrity-gate.md` + `user/skills/_components/mcp-coverage-audit.md` (item 5), `user/skills/plan-feature/SKILL.md` (item 6), `user/skills/lazy/SKILL.md` (item 7)

## Phase 7 — Environment & compaction hardening

**Goal:** Runs never die on preconditions; post-compact dispatch fidelity.

**Entry criteria:** None (independent; can run any time after Phase 1).

**Deliverables:**
- [x] Step 0 preflight (symlink, python3, scripts, node) before banner in batch skills + wrappers; failure prints setup recipe, zero cycles consumed
- [x] Windows node path (`/c/nvm4w/nodejs`) baked into preflight/skill-config
- [x] Compaction protocol: on-disk canonical dispatch template re-read after compact; Read-before-Edit rule
- [x] Long-build ownership rule (orchestrator-owned harness-tracked) + `cargo check --release` pre-flight
- [x] `interview_work_log_append` purged from all dispatch templates; canonical-sentinel-filename + work-branch clauses added to base dispatch prompt

**Runtime Verification:**
- [x] Simulated DOA conditions (missing symlink / shadowed python3) caught by preflight with recipe
- [x] `grep -r interview_work_log_append` returns nothing **inside dispatch prompt templates** (cycle-base-prompt.md, input-audit-prompt.md, loop-block.md, research-halt-announcement.md, cloud inlined prompt — all 0); legitimate orchestrator-own work-log steps remain per Rule 11

**Implementation Notes:**

#### Implementation Notes (Phase 7 — Batch 1: WU-1)
**Completed:** 2026-06-10
**Review verdict:** PASS (orchestrator review; subagent GROUND-TRUTH block independently re-run + diffed — git status / wc -l / Step-0.0 grep / bug-state.py-vs-lazy-state.py split all matched; ground-truth verified: yes; placement of all 3 structurally-sensitive insertion sites read directly and confirmed before-banner / before-Step-0, no broken prose flow)
**Work completed:**
- **WU-1** (Step 0 preflight + Windows node path, prose/config): new canonical component `user/skills/_components/lazy-preflight.md` (71 lines) — read-only 4-check block (skills symlink resolves, state-script exists, `python3` runs, node resolvable with `/c/nvm4w/nodejs` prepended when absent), the verbatim setup recipe printed on failure (`.\setup.ps1 repair` + manual `ln -s` recipe with all three claude-config repo paths + python3/node guidance), and a STOP-zero-cycles contract. The Windows Git-Bash node home `/c/nvm4w/nodejs` is BAKED into check 4 so the per-call `export PATH` boilerplate disappears for the rest of the session. New skill-config note `repos/algobooth/.claude/skill-config/lazy-preflight.md` (14 lines) records the baked node path as discoverable config + points to the component. Wired a `## Step 0.0: Environment Preflight (FIRST — before the start banner and before remote sync)` section into all 6 entry points (the 3 batch SKILLs `lazy-batch`/`lazy-bug-batch`/`lazy-batch-cloud` + the 3 wrappers `lazy`/`lazy-bug`/`lazy-cloud`), placed before each file's banner / `## Step 0`. Bug-pipeline files (`lazy-bug-batch`, `lazy-bug`) reference `bug-state.py`; feature/cloud files reference `lazy-state.py`.
**Verification:**
- **Simulated DOA** (Runtime Verification row 1, now ticked): the check block was run in a stripped subshell (`HOME=/tmp/nohome-preflight-test`, `PATH=/usr/bin:/bin`) and correctly emitted `caught missing skills symlink` + `caught missing python3` and set `FAIL=1` — proving the checks fire on the two documented DOA conditions.
- Grep: all 6 SKILLs carry the `Step 0.0` section + a `lazy-preflight.md` reference; the bug/feature state-script split is correct per file.
**Integration notes:**
- The preflight runs BEFORE Step 0.4 remote sync and the first `lazy-state.py`/`bug-state.py` probe in the batch skills, satisfying the "zero cycles consumed on failure" deliverable (the state script is never called when a check fails).
- The 3 wrappers (`lazy`/`lazy-bug`/`lazy-cloud`) have no `Step 0.4`; the inserted body's "before Step 0.4 remote sync" phrase is harmlessly over-specified there — the dominant "very first action of this invocation" instruction is unambiguous. Left as-is (cosmetic, not a defect).
- Scripts untouched (prose/config only) → the three `--test` regression gates are byte-identical pass (run at batch commit).
**Files modified:**
- `user/skills/_components/lazy-preflight.md` — NEW canonical preflight component
- `repos/algobooth/.claude/skill-config/lazy-preflight.md` — NEW skill-config node-path note + pointer
- `user/skills/lazy-batch/SKILL.md`, `user/skills/lazy-bug-batch/SKILL.md`, `repos/algobooth/.claude/skills/lazy-batch-cloud/SKILL.md` — Step 0.0 wiring (batch skills)

#### Implementation Notes (Phase 7 — Batch 2: WU-2)
**Completed:** 2026-06-10
**Review verdict:** PASS (orchestrator review; subagent GROUND-TRUTH block independently re-run + diffed — git status / wc -l 43 / both greps matched; ground-truth verified: yes; placement confirmed by direct read — the discipline paragraph sits immediately after each `### 1d.` heading in all 3 batch SKILLs)
**Work completed:**
- **WU-2** (compaction protocol, prose): new component `user/skills/_components/lazy-dispatch-template.md` (43 lines) — the on-disk, compaction-survivable canonical dispatch **envelope**: (1) the cycle dispatch skeleton (`description`, `subagent_type`, the REQUIRED-and-never-omit `model:` field — "opus" normal / "sonnet" only on the LOOP-DETECTED branch, prompt envelope), explicitly NOT a re-inline of the prompt body (which stays in `_components/lazy-batch-prompts/cycle-base-prompt.md`); (2) the **Read-before-Edit rule** (compaction resets read-state → re-`Read` any file before `Edit`/`Write`); (3) the **manual-compact-during-dispatch cadence** documented as the SANCTIONED operator pattern (compact at a cycle boundary, not mid-dispatch) with the post-compact recovery sequence. Wired a "Compaction discipline — re-read the dispatch template first" paragraph into the `### 1d. Compose and dispatch the cycle subagent` section of all 3 batch SKILLs (`lazy-batch`, `lazy-bug-batch`, `lazy-batch-cloud`), placed as the first body paragraph under the heading.
**Integration notes:**
- The template is the *envelope* and `cycle-base-prompt.md` (Phase 6 WU-2) is the *contents* — a clean separation: future edits to the dispatch shape (fields/model) go in the template; edits to the prompt text go in the prompt component.
- Directly addresses the audit's two post-compaction failure modes (41% dropped `model:`, 13 Edit-without-Read errors) by giving the orchestrator an on-disk artifact to re-read at every dispatch and after every compact boundary.
- Scripts untouched → three `--test` gates byte-identical pass (run at batch commit).
**Files modified:**
- `user/skills/_components/lazy-dispatch-template.md` — NEW canonical dispatch envelope + Read-before-Edit + manual-compact cadence
- `user/skills/lazy-batch/SKILL.md`, `user/skills/lazy-bug-batch/SKILL.md`, `repos/algobooth/.claude/skills/lazy-batch-cloud/SKILL.md` — Step 1d compaction-discipline paragraph

#### Implementation Notes (Phase 7 — Batch 3: WU-3)
**Completed:** 2026-06-10
**Review verdict:** PASS (orchestrator review; subagent GROUND-TRUTH block independently re-run + diffed — git status / wc -l 23 / both note greps / cloud-Tauri-absence / cargo-check greps all matched; ground-truth verified: yes. The subagent ellipsized two grep lines in its pasted block; the orchestrator's fresh full re-run confirmed the complete verbatim content, so no rework — cosmetic report abbreviation only)
**Work completed:**
- **WU-3** (long-build ownership rule + `cargo check --release` pre-flight, prose/config): new canonical config doc `repos/algobooth/.claude/skill-config/long-build-ownership.md` (23 lines) — codifies that any build/test expected to exceed a subagent turn is **orchestrator-owned** as a `Bash` `run_in_background` harness-tracked task (a subagent-backgrounded process tree is torn down at the subagent's turn end — a `tauri build` silently vanished this way), generalizing the Step 1d.0 `tauri dev` ownership property; and requires `cargo check --release` before committing to a 20–40 min packaged `tauri build`. Wired a "Long-build ownership (harness-tracked)" paragraph into the `### 1d.` preamble of all 3 batch SKILLs (immediately after the Batch-2 compaction-discipline paragraph): the workstation variant (`lazy-batch`, `lazy-bug-batch`) names `tauri build` + `cargo check --release`; the cloud variant (`lazy-batch-cloud`) is adapted ("Cloud has no Tauri runtime, so packaged `tauri build` does not run here — but the ownership rule is universal" for long `cargo`/`/execute-plan` runs).
**Integration notes:**
- The config doc reference path is repo-relative `.claude/skill-config/long-build-ownership.md` (NOT `~/.claude/skill-config/...` — that symlink does not exist; the skill-config dir resolves from the AlgoBooth repo cwd via the per-repo `.claude/skill-config` symlink).
- Builds on Step 1d.0's established orchestrator-owned-`run_in_background` property; HARD CONSTRAINT 1 explicitly preserved (Bash-only process ownership, no `Write`/`Edit` scope growth).
- Scripts untouched → three `--test` gates byte-identical pass (run at batch commit).
**Files modified:**
- `repos/algobooth/.claude/skill-config/long-build-ownership.md` — NEW canonical long-build ownership rule
- `user/skills/lazy-batch/SKILL.md`, `user/skills/lazy-bug-batch/SKILL.md`, `repos/algobooth/.claude/skills/lazy-batch-cloud/SKILL.md` — Step 1d long-build ownership paragraph (cloud variant adapted)

#### Implementation Notes (Phase 7 — Batch 4: WU-4 + Post-Phase)
**Completed:** 2026-06-10
**Review verdict:** PASS (orchestrator review; subagent GROUND-TRUTH block independently re-run + diffed — git status / wc -l (233, 897) / clause greps / zero-work-log all matched; ground-truth verified: yes; both insertions read directly and confirmed INSIDE the prompt fences immediately before `After the skill returns:`, closing fence intact)
**Work completed:**
- **WU-4** (prompt hygiene, prose; grep-verified): two anti-deviation clauses added to the cycle **dispatch prompt templates**, and the stale-tool purge confirmed already satisfied.
  - **Purge (drift-reconciled — Rule 11):** `interview_work_log_append` is ALREADY absent from every dispatch prompt template (cycle-base-prompt.md, input-audit-prompt.md, loop-block.md, research-halt-announcement.md, cloud's inlined Step-1d prompt — all grep 0). It was removed during the Phase 6 prompt extraction; WU-4's purge half is a verified no-op. The legitimate orchestrator-own Work-Log steps (the `/lazy`, `/lazy-bug`, `/lazy-cloud` wrappers' final step; `/log`; `_components/work-log.md`; this `/execute-plan` skill's Step 4a; the "does NOT call" meta-notes in plan-feature/plan-bug/retro-feature/realign-spec) correctly REMAIN — they are not dispatch prompts (Rule 11).
  - **Additive (canonical-sentinel + work-branch clauses):** added a "Sentinel + git hygiene" block to `cycle-base-prompt.md` (the shared base prompt for BOTH `/lazy-batch` and `/lazy-bug-batch` — lazy-bug-batch Step 1d references it) carrying (1) **CANONICAL SENTINEL FILENAMES** (use the exact name from the canonical set; a mis-named sentinel is invisible to the state script and silently loops the pipeline; re-read sentinel-frontmatter.md before writing) and (2) **WORK-BRANCH-ONLY COMMITS** (current work branch only; never main/master, never --force, never a new branch). Cloud's inlined Step-1d prompt already carried the work-branch clause (lines ~482-484), so it received ONLY the canonical-sentinel clause (feature-pipeline set). Both inserted INSIDE the prompt fence, immediately before `After the skill returns:`. Closes the 3 subagent git/sentinel deviations seen in the Jun-9 run.
**Post-Phase — Integration Verification (Phase 7 whole):** all six grep gates green — (1) `Step 0.0: Environment Preflight` present in all 6 entry points; (2) all 4 new component/config files present on disk; (3) `lazy-dispatch-template.md` referenced by all 3 batch SKILLs; (4) `long-build-ownership.md` referenced by all 3 batch SKILLs; (5) both dispatch prompts carry the sentinel clause; (6) zero `interview_work_log_append` across ALL dispatch prompt templates. The five new artifacts cohere as one preconditions+resilience layer: preflight aborts DOA runs at zero cycles BEFORE the banner/remote-sync/first-probe; the dispatch template + Read-before-Edit rule survive compaction (re-read on every dispatch); the long-build rule keeps any over-a-turn build orchestrator-owned (subagent-backgrounded processes die at turn end); the prompt-hygiene clauses stop subagent sentinel/git deviations.
**CLAUDE.md review:** no structural CLAUDE.md update warranted — the preflight component REFERENCES AlgoBooth `CLAUDE.md`'s "Claude Code Config" + "WSL PATH note" (which already document the symlink recipe + node path); the node path is now also baked into `skill-config/lazy-preflight.md`. No new public surface requires a CLAUDE.md edit (consistent with Phases 2-3's CLAUDE.md-review conclusions).
**Files modified:**
- `user/skills/_components/lazy-batch-prompts/cycle-base-prompt.md` — canonical-sentinel + work-branch clauses (covers lazy-batch + lazy-bug-batch)
- `repos/algobooth/.claude/skills/lazy-batch-cloud/SKILL.md` — canonical-sentinel clause (cloud inlined prompt; work-branch already present)

#### Post-Phase (Phase 7 — part close = SERIES FINAL)
**Part-end full quality gate (MANDATORY, all exit 0):** `python3 ~/.claude/scripts/lazy-state.py --test` (0), `python3 ~/.claude/scripts/bug-state.py --test` (0), `python3 ~/.claude/scripts/test_lazy_core.py` ("All tests passed", 0) — run as the final chained command before the part-close commit. Scripts were untouched across all of Phase 7 (prose/config only), so every batch's gates were byte-identical green.
**Series status:** Phase 7 is the FINAL part (7 of 7) of the lazy-hardening series. With all Phase 7 deliverables + both runtime-verification rows ticked and Phases 1-6 already complete, the entire 7-part series is DONE. Plan part-7 frontmatter flipped `Ready` → `Complete`.

---

## Phase 8 — Script-emitted cycle prompts + prompt diet + sha-free chat output

**Scope:** `--emit-prompt` makes the state scripts the single assembler of the cycle dispatch
prompt — closing the last unscripted deterministic mechanic left out of the Phase-5
script-ification. The canonical template is rewritten on a diet (each rule exactly once,
war-story prose dropped, stable policy pointer-ized), parameterized (`{work_branch}`,
bug/feature tokens), and sectioned so per-skill / per-pipeline / per-mode selection is
mechanical. Orchestrator chat output drops commit shas (operator request — shas are noise on a
phone; durable provenance shas in docs/sentinels are kept).

**Why (operator-commissioned, 2026-06-10):** the 20.7MB WSL audit showed the orchestrator
re-TYPING the ~2K-token cycle prompt every dispatch (1.64M output tokens, ~70% boilerplate —
more than all 311 subagents combined) and dropping bindings post-compaction (41% lost
`model:`). The template itself accreted 2–4× repetition per rule (inline override ×3, commit
discipline ×4, sentinel discipline ×3) plus mechanism/war-story prose, and the base template
carries a "never push main" rule that the AlgoBooth orchestrator must countermand with an
inline NOTE (rule-then-exception). The cloud variant retains a hand-synced ~230-line inline
copy of the prompt (accepted follow-up from the post-implementation review — subsumed here).

**Entry criteria:** Phases 5–7 (probe enrichment flags, componentized prompts, dispatch
template) — all complete.

**Validated Assumptions:**

| assumption | how-confirmed (`grep` / `runtime` / `spike`) | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| the script can locate the template via its own path through the `~/.claude` symlinks | runtime | `Path('~/.claude/scripts/lazy-state.py').resolve()` → `<claude-config>/user/scripts/lazy-state.py`; `parent.parent / 'skills/_components/lazy-batch-prompts/cycle-base-prompt.md'` exists (probe run 2026-06-10, this session) |
| probe payload carries `feature_id` / `feature_name` / `spec_path` / `current_step` / `sub_skill` / `sub_skill_args` in BOTH scripts (bug-state reuses the `feature_*` keys for bugs) | grep | `lazy-state.py:120-124`, `bug-state.py:217-221` (code-provable: the emitter consumes the scripts' own in-process dict, no cross-process boundary) |
| persisted `repeat_count` is per-pipeline (parallel feature+bug runs don't reset each other's streaks) | grep | commit `f7f8bb3` (per-pipeline loop-signature files) |
| work branch resolvable at emit time | runtime | `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` → `main` in claude-config (same subprocess pattern as `_current_head`) |
| retro graders key on literal prompt anchors | grep | `lazy-batch-retro/SKILL.md:381` (`INLINE OVERRIDE — LOAD-BEARING` unconditional in the workstation template), `:293` (R-O-4 load-bearing clauses incl. `Operating mode: batch`), `:379` (`CLOUD OVERRIDE — LOAD-BEARING`) — the rewrite MUST preserve these literal strings |

**Deliverables:**
- [x] WU-1 (prose) — `cycle-base-prompt.md` rewritten as the deduplicated, sectioned, parameterized template: `<!-- @section <name> pipelines=feature,bug modes=workstation,cloud skills=all|<csv> -->` markers; every rule stated exactly ONCE (header comment carries a rule-inventory table R1–R16 mapping each surviving rule to its single section; the turn-end pre-return checklist is the ONE sanctioned restatement); mechanism/war-story prose dropped (≤1-line rationale max); D7 block reduced to the operational core (scope test → most-complete path → `⚖` disclosure → never NEEDS_INPUT for scope-class) + `completeness-policy.md` pointer; work branch parameterized as `{work_branch}` (kills the rule-then-exception NOTE); bug/feature differences tokenized (`{item_label}`, `{pipeline_phrase}`, `{receipt_name}`, `{mark_pseudo}`, `{forbidden_status}`, sentinel-set lines as tiny per-pipeline sections) so lazy-bug-batch's substitution list + "No premature Fixed" block become dead; cloud deltas folded in as `modes=cloud` sections (subsumes lazy-batch-cloud's hand-synced inline copy) keeping the literal `CLOUD OVERRIDE — LOAD-BEARING` marker; retro anchors preserved verbatim (`Operating mode: batch`, `INLINE OVERRIDE — LOAD-BEARING`, ``This subagent does NOT have the `Agent` tool``); subagent report contract asks "committed+pushed | no commit" (NO commit hash); `loop-block.md` parameterized for both pipelines (`{receipt_name}` in the never-author list). Size target: workstation execute-plan emission ≤ ~900 tokens; mcp-test (largest) ≤ ~1300.
- [x] WU-2 (TDD) — `lazy_core.emit_cycle_prompt(repo_root, state, *, pipeline, cloud=False, repeat_count=None, template_dir=None) -> dict | None`: `None` for pseudo-skills (`__*`) and terminal/idle probes; parses the section markers; selects by (pipeline, mode, normalized sub_skill); binds all tokens (`{work_branch}` via `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`, safe fallback `"the current branch"`; mcp-test runtime variant chosen by the spec's PHASES.md `**MCP runtime:**` line, binding `{untestability_reason}`); REFUSES (returns `{"ok": false, "refused": …}`) on any unbound `{token}` residue or unknown section reference — never emits a half-bound prompt; appends the loop block and selects `model: "sonnet"` when `repeat_count >= 2`, else `"opus"`. CLI `--emit-prompt` on BOTH scripts: flag-gated output fields `cycle_prompt` + `cycle_model` (byte-identical default output — same discipline as `--probe`/`--repeat-count`; NO baseline regeneration); composes with `--repeat-count` (the same invocation's count drives the loop block). Unit tests: selection matrix, binding completeness (zero `\{[a-z_]+\}` residue) for every (pipeline × mode × skill) combination, pseudo → None, loop append + model flip at repeat_count 2, mcp-test variant routing (both branches), bug-token binding (FIXED.md present / COMPLETED.md absent), cloud section inclusion/exclusion, refusal path.
- [x] WU-3 (prose) — consumers: `lazy-batch` Step 1a/1d (probe call gains `--emit-prompt`; dispatch uses `cycle_prompt` verbatim + `model: cycle_model`; hand-binding + loop-block-append + model-selection prose deleted — script-owned; `prev_cycle_signature` retained for Step-2 forward-progress + post-cycle bookkeeping); `lazy-bug-batch` Step 1d (substitution list + "No premature Fixed" block deleted; consumes `bug-state.py --emit-prompt`); `lazy-batch-cloud` Step 1d (the ~230-line inline prompt copy DELETED → `lazy-state.py --cloud … --emit-prompt`; cloud-specific dispatch nuances like background-dispatch remain); `lazy-dispatch-template.md` (prompt field = `cycle_prompt` verbatim, `model:` = `cycle_model`); Step 1d.0 variant-swap prose simplified (script chooses the mcp-test prompt variant; the orchestrator keeps the BOOT decision).
- [x] WU-4 (prose) — sha-free orchestrator chat output: `orchestrator-voice.md` T4 example drops `· a1b2c3d`; `lazy-batch` §1c.5 item 3 ("+ the sentinel/plan commit short-sha") + §1e item 2 ("+ the cycle's commit short-sha, or `—`") + the bottom quick-reference `done` line; `lazy-bug-batch` quick-reference `done` line; `lazy-batch-cloud` §1c.5 analog + §1e + quick-reference. Durable provenance shas are intentionally KEPT (FIXED.md `**Fix commit:**` evidence header, plan `source_commit`, `validated_commit`, retro citation requirements, work-log `commit` field) — the removal is chat-output-only.

**Files likely modified:**
- `user/skills/_components/lazy-batch-prompts/cycle-base-prompt.md` — rewrite (WU-1)
- `user/skills/_components/lazy-batch-prompts/loop-block.md` — parameterize (WU-1)
- `user/scripts/lazy_core.py` — `emit_cycle_prompt` (WU-2)
- `user/scripts/lazy-state.py`, `user/scripts/bug-state.py` — `--emit-prompt` CLI (WU-2)
- `user/scripts/test_lazy_core.py` — unit tests (WU-2)
- `user/skills/lazy-batch/SKILL.md`, `user/skills/lazy-bug-batch/SKILL.md`, `repos/algobooth/.claude/skills/lazy-batch-cloud/SKILL.md` — consumption + sha removal (WU-3, WU-4)
- `user/skills/_components/lazy-dispatch-template.md` — envelope update (WU-3)
- `user/skills/_components/orchestrator-voice.md` — T4 example (WU-4)

**Testing Strategy:** WU-2 is TDD with unit tests in `test_lazy_core.py` (RED→GREEN; registered
in `_TESTS`); the flag-gating discipline means NO smoke-baseline regeneration — the three
regression gates passing UNCHANGED is itself the byte-identical-default proof. WU-1/3/4 are
prose: verified by grep gates (anchors present, sha specs absent, zero unbound tokens via the
WU-2 binding-completeness tests which read the REAL template file).

**Integration Notes for Next Phase:**
- After this phase the orchestrators' Step 1d is consume-and-dispatch; any future prompt-text
  change goes in the COMPONENT (sectioned template), never in SKILL prose, and is picked up by
  both pipelines + cloud automatically.
- `prev_cycle_signature` is retained only for the Step-2 forward-progress check and T2 tag; a
  future phase could retire it in favor of `repeat_count` everywhere.

**Context from prior phases:**
- Phase 5 established the flag-gated byte-identical-default discipline (`--repeat-count`,
  `--probe`) — WU-2 must follow it exactly (fields appear ONLY under `--emit-prompt`).
- Phase 6 WU-2 extracted the templates; its pitfall note ("future edits to a prompt template
  must edit the COMPONENT file, not re-inline it into SKILL.md") is strengthened by WU-3
  deleting the cloud inline copy.
- Phase 7 WU-4's sentinel/git-hygiene clauses and the adversarial-review D-4 fix
  (`validated_commit` producer in the mcp-test override) are LOAD-BEARING rules the WU-1
  rewrite must preserve (rule inventory entries).

**Implementation Notes:**

#### Implementation Notes (Phase 8 — Batches 1–3: WU-1+WU-4, WU-2, WU-3)
**Completed:** 2026-06-10
**Review verdict:** PASS (orchestrator review per batch; WU-1 read in full + one dedup miss fixed inline (cloud `task` section restated cloud-override's BLOCKED.md rule — removed); WU-3 consumption regions read in full + one prose inaccuracy fixed inline (consumption text named `{feature_name}`/`{feature_id}` where the template's real tokens are `{item_name}`/`{item_id}` — corrected in lazy-batch + cloud); all three regression gates independently re-run by the orchestrator after WU-2)
**Work completed:**
- **WU-1 + WU-4 (Batch 1, two parallel agents):** `cycle-base-prompt.md` rewritten 333→357 lines but each-rule-once — 18 `@section` markers (per-mode variants of task/hard-contract/turn-end/resume-safety; per-skill execute-plan/retro/retro-feature/mcp-test sections; mcp-test `variant=runtime-up|no-runtime`), rule inventory R1–R16 in the header, retro grading anchors preserved verbatim, D7 condensed to ~10 lines + pointer, `{work_branch}` parameterization replaces the "never main" rule-then-exception, 14-token vocabulary, cloud deltas folded in from the cloud SKILL's inline copy. `loop-block.md` re-headed for emitter appending + `{item_id}`. Sha removal: 8 chat-output sites across orchestrator-voice (T4 example) + the 3 batch SKILLs (§1c.5 done lines, §1e done lines, quick-reference blocks); lazy-batch-retro confirmed to have NO sha-on-done-line grading expectation (no edit needed); durable provenance shas kept.
- **WU-2 (Batch 2, TDD):** `lazy_core.emit_cycle_prompt` + helpers (`_parse_cycle_template`, `_parse_section_attrs`, `_read_mcp_runtime_decision`, `_strip_loop_fence`, `_emit_work_branch`, `_default_cycle_template_dir`); `--emit-prompt` on both scripts gated after the `--repeat-count` block (same-invocation count drives loop-block append + opus→sonnet flip); output fields `cycle_prompt`/`cycle_model` (+ `cycle_prompt_refused`), null on pseudo/terminal; refuses on `\{[a-z_]+\}` residue. 11 RED→GREEN tests (161→172), binding-completeness matrix runs against the REAL template so emitter/template drift fails loudly. Baselines pass UNREGENERATED (byte-identical-default proof).
- **WU-3 (Batch 3, prose):** all 3 orchestrators consume `cycle_prompt` verbatim + `cycle_model` from ONE probe call (`--repeat-count --probe --emit-prompt`); hand-binding/splice prose deleted; in-session `prev_cycle_signature` retained as cross-check (disagreement → re-probe, never hand-append); `cycle_prompt_refused` → T6 deviation + documented degraded hand-binding fallback; cloud's hand-synced ~230-line inline prompt DELETED (−265 lines; closes the post-implementation-review accepted follow-up "cloud retains hand-synced inline copies"); Step 1d.0 step 4 variant-splicing replaced (script owns the variant; orchestrator keeps the boot decision); `lazy-dispatch-template.md` envelope updated + "never reconstruct prompts from memory — re-probe with `--emit-prompt`" post-compact rule.
**Ground-truth verification:** orchestrator independently re-ran all three gates after WU-2 (exit 0/0/0, `All tests passed`, zero `tests/baselines/` diffs) and end-to-end probed the LIVE AlgoBooth bug queue with `bug-state.py --repeat-count --emit-prompt` — fully bound bug-flavored prompt, zero token residue, ~9.4KB with loop block appended and `cycle_model: sonnet` (persisted streak was live). The verification probe's increment of the bug-pipeline persisted repeat counter was then NEUTRALIZED (dummy-signature `update_repeat_count` call) so the running /lazy-bug-batch session's next real probe resets to 1. `lint-skills.py` OK after every batch.
**Integration notes:**
- The orchestrator's happy-path cycle is now: ONE probe call (routing + guards + header + fully-bound prompt + model) → Agent dispatch → record. Prompt-text changes happen ONLY in the sectioned component; both pipelines + cloud pick them up with zero SKILL edits.
- The emitted workstation execute-plan prompt is ~1.2K tokens vs the old hand-bound ~1.8–2K, and — the larger win — the orchestrator no longer re-types it (the old failure mode: 1.64M orchestrator output tokens, ~70% boilerplate, 41% post-compaction `model:` drops).
- Size note: WU-1's ~900-token soft target for the execute-plan assembly landed at ~1.2K — the overage is irreducible numbered hard-rule lists (hard-contract + turn-end); completeness was prioritized over the soft target (⚖ policy: size target vs rule completeness → kept all rules).
**Pitfalls & guidance:**
- The template header's marker grammar + token list IS the emitter's parsing contract (`emit_cycle_prompt`) — change either side only in lockstep, and the binding-completeness matrix tests (which read the real template) are the tripwire.
- The retro grading anchors (`Operating mode: batch`, `INLINE OVERRIDE — LOAD-BEARING`, `CLOUD OVERRIDE — LOAD-BEARING`, the cloud EXPECTED-state phrase on one physical line) are load-bearing literals in the template — renaming them breaks `/lazy-batch-retro` mode detection.
- Probing a live pipeline with `--repeat-count` mutates the persisted streak — verification probes should omit the flag or neutralize afterward.
**Carried follow-ups (future-phase candidates, NOT blocking):**
- `prev_cycle_signature` could be fully retired in favor of the script's `repeat_count` (Step-2 forward-progress + T2 tag are the remaining consumers).
- The degraded hand-binding fallback in lazy-batch Step 1d has no mechanical test; if `cycle_prompt_refused` is ever observed in production, consider a `--emit-prompt --strict` mode that exits non-zero instead.
**Files modified:** `user/skills/_components/lazy-batch-prompts/{cycle-base-prompt,loop-block}.md`, `user/skills/_components/{orchestrator-voice,lazy-dispatch-template}.md`, `user/scripts/{lazy_core,lazy-state,bug-state,test_lazy_core}.py`, `user/skills/{lazy-batch,lazy-bug-batch}/SKILL.md`, `repos/algobooth/.claude/skills/lazy-batch-cloud/SKILL.md`, this PHASES.md.

## Phase 9 — Completion coherence + streak accuracy + dispatch-prompt parity

**Scope:** Close the structural gaps surfaced by the 2026-06-11 live `/lazy-batch` run
(transcript `5c33b6ba`, observed from a parallel session): (1) the validation→completion
ownership gap that leaves PHASES.md incoherent at `__mark_complete__` time (top-level
`Complete` + per-phase `In-progress` + unchecked verification rows — guaranteed for any
feature whose final phases carry Runtime Verification rows, caught only by AlgoBooth's
`qg:docs-consistency` after the flip lands); (2) `repeat_count` false positives (inspection
probes inflate the persisted streak; legitimate re-validation repeats misdiagnosed as stalls,
forcing a documented model-override deviation); (3) `--verify-ledger` false alarms on
multi-part plans (feature-level checks fire while later parts are legitimately pending);
(4) resolution/recovery subagents missing the git contract (a blocked-resolution apply
subagent committed to a stray branch); (5) probe-output hygiene.

**Why each is structural (evidence):** transcript blocks 371/392 (Recover meta-cycle: the
orchestrator itself identified "check-docs-consistency.ts counts ALL phase checkboxes with no
verification carve-out, but lazy_core's completion gate exempts verification-only rows");
`check-docs-consistency.ts:1454-1516` (`spec-complete-phases-not`, `complete-but-unchecked`,
`all-checked-but-not-complete`); `apply_pseudo __mark_complete__` flips ONLY top-level Status
lines; transcript block 269 (streak hit 5 with 1 real dispatch; ⚠ deviation override of the
script's sonnet/loop-block selection); block 112 (verify-ledger plan_complete/deliverables_done
false for a genuinely-pending part-2 — "NOT residue"); block 73 (apply subagent landed work on
`track-filestream-blocker-resolution` side branch — resolution prompts carry no work-branch
clause); block 269 (`cycle_prompt_5.txt` accidentally written into the repo tree).

**Entry criteria:** Phase 8 complete (sectioned template + emitter are the surfaces WU-4 edits).

**Validated Assumptions:**

| assumption | how-confirmed (`grep` / `runtime` / `spike`) | evidence |

**Deliverables:**
- [x] WU-1 (TDD, scripts) — **completion-coherence enforcement in `apply_pseudo`** (`__mark_complete__` AND `__mark_fixed__`): new fence-aware per-phase parser in `lazy_core` (`### Phase` headings → per-phase `**Status:**` + checked/unchecked counts); BEFORE any write, (a) AUTO-FLIP any phase with ≥1 checkbox, zero unchecked, and a non-Complete/non-Superseded Status line → `Complete` (mirrors the checker's `all-checked-but-not-complete` rule — deterministic, safe); (b) REFUSE (existing `refused:` convention, zero writes incl. no receipt) when any phase would remain incoherent after (a): any unchecked checkbox in any phase (verification rows included — by completion time the exemption's job is done), or any phase Status not Complete/Superseded (zero-checkbox non-Complete phases refuse too — no mechanical signal to flip on). Refusal message names the offending phases/rows so the orchestrator can route a corrective coherence cycle. Existing apply_pseudo fixtures with incoherent PHASES updated intent-preservingly (make them coherent OR assert the new refusal — whichever the test's intent was).
- [x] WU-2 (TDD, scripts) — **streak accuracy**: `update_repeat_count` persists HEAD alongside `{signature, count}`; identical signature + ADVANCED head → reset to 1 (commits landing between probes are mechanical proof of forward progress — the live run's "partial → re-certify" repeat was exactly this); identical signature + same head → increment; legacy file without `head` → increment (backward-compat) + store head. New `peek` mode (`--repeat-count-peek` on both scripts): computes the would-be count WITHOUT writing the state file (diagnostic probes stop inflating the streak; `--emit-prompt` composes with either flag). `loop-block.md` gains one line: the streak is HEAD-aware, so this block firing means NO commits landed between identical probes — a genuine stall.
- [x] WU-3 (TDD, scripts) — **plan-scoped verify-ledger**: `verify_ledger(repo_root, spec_path, plan_path=None)`; with `plan_path`: `plan_complete` = THIS plan's frontmatter `status: Complete`, `deliverables_done` = `_unchecked_wus_in_plan_scope(phases, plan's phase set)` empty (verification-only rows in scope still exempt — mid-feature semantics unchanged); `clean_tree`/`head_matches_origin` unchanged. CLI: `--verify-ledger SPEC --plan PLAN` (reuses the existing `--plan` flag). Feature-level mode byte-identical when `--plan` absent.
- [x] WU-4 (prose) — **prompt/component parity**: (a) `cycle-base-prompt.md` mcp-test-common section (R14) + `repos/algobooth/.claude/skills/mcp-test/SKILL.md`: after writing VALIDATED.md, the validation cycle RECONCILES PHASES.md — tick each unchecked Runtime Verification row the validation evidence covers (with an evidence annotation), re-scope rows it does not cover (follow-up note or MCP_TEST_RESULTS partial, `⚖`-disclosed), and flip per-phase Status lines whose boxes are now all ticked (R7 already permits per-phase flips); (b) work-branch clause (commit/push to the current work branch ONLY; never create a branch; never force-push) added to `blocked-resolution.md`, `decision-resume.md`, `halt-resolution.md`, and the Step 1e.4a recovery-dispatch spec in `lazy-batch/SKILL.md` (+ cloud mirror) — every prompt that can lead to a commit carries the git contract; (c) `completion-integrity-gate.md` + the `__mark_complete__`/`__mark_fixed__` handler prose in `lazy-batch`/`lazy-bug-batch`/`lazy-batch-cloud`: document the new apply-pseudo coherence refusal as the mechanical third gate (refusal → corrective coherence cycle, mirroring Gate-1 halt handling); (d) Step 1e.4a (+ cloud guard) passes `--plan {plan_file}` to `--verify-ledger` after `/execute-plan` cycles and keys recovery on the scoped result; (e) probe-hygiene line in the three batch SKILLs' probe guidance: diagnostic probe output goes to the OS temp dir, never the repo tree; diagnostic probes use `--repeat-count-peek` (never `--repeat-count`, which is reserved for the single dispatch-bound probe).

**Files likely modified:**
- `user/scripts/lazy_core.py`, `user/scripts/lazy-state.py`, `user/scripts/bug-state.py`, `user/scripts/test_lazy_core.py` — WU-1/2/3
- `user/skills/_components/lazy-batch-prompts/{cycle-base-prompt,loop-block}.md` — WU-2/4
- `user/skills/_components/{blocked-resolution,decision-resume,halt-resolution,completion-integrity-gate}.md` — WU-4
- `user/skills/{lazy-batch,lazy-bug-batch}/SKILL.md`, `repos/algobooth/.claude/skills/{lazy-batch-cloud,mcp-test}/SKILL.md` — WU-4
- `user/scripts/tests/baselines/*` — only if a smoke fixture legitimately shifts (expected: none; apply_pseudo/verify_ledger/update_repeat_count are unit-tested, not smoke-fixtured on these paths)

**Testing Strategy:** WU-1/2/3 are TDD in `test_lazy_core.py` (RED→GREEN, `_TESTS` registry).
Key discriminators: WU-1 refusal proves ZERO writes (no receipt, no status flip, sentinels
untouched); WU-1 auto-flip proves body-byte-stability outside the flipped Status lines; WU-2
head-advance test makes a real commit in the git fixture between calls; WU-2 peek test proves
two peeks + one advance yields count 2, not 4; WU-3 part-1-complete/part-2-pending fixture
proves feature-level fails while plan-scoped passes. Flag-gating discipline: all three gates
green with baselines UNREGENERATED.

**Integration Notes for Next Phase:**
- After WU-1, `lazy_core`'s and `check-docs-consistency.ts`'s definitions of a completable
  feature are equivalent (the checker's three coherence rules are enforced pre-flip by the
  script). A future AlgoBooth-side change could have `qg:docs-consistency` import the same
  semantics rather than re-deriving them.
- After WU-2, the loop block fires only on same-tuple + same-HEAD — `prev_cycle_signature`
  retirement (Phase 8 carried follow-up) becomes safer.

**Context from prior phases:**
- Phase 5 WU-2 established `apply_pseudo` as the single receipt author with the `refused:`
  convention — WU-1 extends, never bypasses, that gate.
- Phase 5 WU-4 + the pre-test polish (f7f8bb3) established the per-pipeline persisted streak —
  WU-2 changes its payload shape (add `head`) with explicit legacy fallback.
- Phase 8 established the sectioned template + emitter — WU-4(a) edits the R14 section ONLY in
  the component (never SKILL-inlined), and the binding-completeness matrix tests are the
  tripwire for token mistakes.

**Implementation Notes:**

#### Implementation Notes (Phase 9 — Batches 1–2: WU-1+WU-4, WU-2+WU-3)
**Completed:** 2026-06-11
**Review verdict:** PASS (orchestrator review per batch; all three gates independently re-run after each batch — exit 0/0/0, baselines UNREGENERATED both times; lint OK; live double-peek probe against the AlgoBooth queue verified `--repeat-count-peek` is non-mutating end-to-end)
**Work completed:**
- **WU-1 (TDD, 172→188):** `lazy_core.parse_phases` (fence-aware per-phase parser: heading / first in-section `**Status:**` / checked+unchecked counts; top-level Status not captured) + `_phase_completion_plan` + coherence gate in `apply_pseudo` for BOTH `__mark_complete__` and `__mark_fixed__`, inserted after the evidence gate + receipt-noop, before any write: auto-flips all-ticked non-Complete/Superseded phases (Status line edit only, body bytes pinned by test), refuses with zero writes (no receipt, no flips, no sentinel deletions) naming each offending phase when any phase retains unchecked boxes (Superseded exempt) or a non-Complete/Superseded status; zero-checkbox non-Complete phases refuse (no mechanical flip signal). Return dict gains `flipped_phases`. Stricter-than-spec judgment (⚖ disclosed): a status-LESS phase with unchecked boxes still refuses (the no-status carve-out applies to the straggler check only). Existing fixtures needed NO adjustment (they carry no PHASES.md; absent-PHASES behavior preserved).
- **WU-2 (TDD, +5):** `update_repeat_count` persists `head`; identical signature + advanced HEAD → reset 1; same head (or both None) → increment; legacy file without `head` → increment + store. `peek=True` / `--repeat-count-peek` (both scripts, mutually exclusive with `--repeat-count` via `_die`) reads without writing; composes with `--emit-prompt`. `lazy_core` gained its own `_current_head` (deliberate duplication — lazy_core must not import a sibling script; documented).
- **WU-3 (TDD, +8):** `verify_ledger(plan_path=None)` — plan-scoped `plan_complete` (that part's frontmatter Complete) + `deliverables_done` (in-scope WUs ticked; verification exemption preserved via new `_phases_text_scoped_to` slicing + `remaining_unchecked_are_verification_only`); empty/missing `phases:` falls back to feature-level (no vacuous pass); CLI reuses `--plan`.
- **WU-4 (prose, 10 files):** mcp-test reconciliation duty (cycle-base-prompt R14 bullet + mcp-test SKILL subsection at the VALIDATED.md write locus); WORK-BRANCH-ONLY clause in blocked-resolution/decision-resume/halt-resolution + 1e.4a recovery spec + cloud recovery sentence; coherence-refusal documented as the mechanical third gate (completion-integrity-gate.md + all three batch handlers, refusal → corrective coherence cycle); 1e.4a + cloud guard plan-scoped (`--plan {plan_file}` for /execute-plan, feature-level for /mcp-test); probe hygiene (peek for diagnostics, dispatch-bound `--repeat-count` once per cycle, no probe output in the repo tree) + HEAD-aware line inside loop-block.md's fenced block. Template marker/token contract untouched (0 residue; marker count unchanged).
**Ground-truth verification:** subagent GROUND-TRUTH blocks cross-checked; orchestrator re-ran gates fresh after each batch (201/201 final), confirmed empty baseline diffs, lint OK, and ran the live CLI checks (double-peek 1/1 stable; plan-scoped CLI verified by the WU-3 agent on a scratch repo: feature-level fails while part-1-scoped exits 0 and part-2-scoped exits 1).
**Integration notes:**
- The completion path now has symmetric ownership: the VALIDATION cycle converts "exempt-pending" verification rows into ticked-with-evidence or re-scoped (judgment, freshest evidence, ⚖-disclosed); `apply_pseudo` performs the deterministic per-phase flips and REFUSES anything still incoherent (mechanics); `check-docs-consistency.ts` and the pipeline now agree on what Complete means — the 2026-06-11 Recover-cycle class is closed pre-flip instead of caught post-flip.
- HEAD-aware streak + peek mode close both live false-positive paths (inspection-probe inflation; legitimate re-validation repeats) — the loop block now fires only on same-tuple + same-HEAD, making `prev_cycle_signature` retirement (Phase 8 follow-up) safer still.
**Pitfalls & guidance:**
- The coherence gate runs AFTER the receipt-noop: re-completing an already-receipted dir never re-refuses (pinned by test) — do not reorder.
- `_current_head` exists in lazy_core AND lazy-state.py by design; keep their contracts identical if either changes.
- Plan-scoped `deliverables_done` slices `### Phase N` sections by the plan's `phases:` set — plans without `phases:` get feature-level semantics deliberately.
**Carried follow-ups (future candidates, NOT blocking):**
- AlgoBooth's `check-docs-consistency.ts` still re-derives the coherence rules independently; a shared semantics import (or a `--coherence-report` script mode the checker consumes) would remove the last duplication.
- The mcp-test reconciliation duty is prompt-enforced, not mechanically gated; if a validation cycle ever skips it, the apply-pseudo refusal is the backstop (by design), but a retro grading rule (R-V-*) for the reconciliation step could be added.

## Post-implementation adversarial review (2026-06-10, separate session)

Three independent adversarial reviewers (scripts / batch orchestrators / components+wrappers+retro)
audited the full `63f9415..ef5b223` range against the plan. Verdict: **implementation largely real
and well-tested, with 3 blockers + 5 gate-weakening defects + ~15 text defects**, all fixed in the
follow-up commit(s) after this section. All three regression gates re-verified green after fixes
(147/147 core; both smoke suites).

**Blockers fixed:**
- **B1 — `--park` was dead text:** all 3 orchestrators parsed the flag but none ever passed
  `--park-needs-input` to the state script, so `parked[]` was always empty and the entire D1/D2
  protocol was unreachable. Fixed: Step 1a park-mode probe wiring in all 3 + `[--park]`
  argument-hints + usage strings.
- **B2 — three conflicting FIXED.md authors:** lazy-bug-batch §1c.5 hand-wrote the receipt while
  the completion-integrity gate named `--apply-pseudo __mark_fixed__` sole author and
  mark-fixed-archive.md said "the gate writes it". Fixed: §1c.5 + mark-fixed-archive.md now
  delegate to `bug-state.py --apply-pseudo __mark_fixed__`; impossible
  `validated_via: deferred-non-cloud` option removed.
- **B3 — `NEEDS_INPUT_FOLLOWUP_{N}.md` was invisible:** input-audit-prompt claimed the script
  re-surfaces it (false — filename-keyed on `NEEDS_INPUT.md`). Fixed: promote-on-resolve rule in
  decision-resume.md + parked-flush.md (lowest-numbered FOLLOWUP renamed to NEEDS_INPUT.md after
  neutralization); false claim corrected.

**Gate-weakening script defects fixed (each with RED→GREEN fixture):**
- D-1: `apply_pseudo __mark_complete__/__mark_fixed__` accepted a content-less (`touch`'d)
  VALIDATED.md — now requires `kind: validated` / `kind: skip-mcp-test`.
- D-2: `apply_pseudo __write_validated_from_skip__` ignored `granted_by: pipeline` — now refuses.
- D-3: bug-state Step 9 lacked both the `granted_by` gate and the `validated_commit` freshness
  gate lazy-state has — both mirrored in (+4 fixtures).
- D-4: nothing ever WROTE `validated_commit` (freshness gate production-inert) — producer added
  to the /mcp-test override in cycle-base-prompt.md + mcp-test SKILL (required going forward).
- D-5: bug-state malformed-queue diagnostic was dead code (load_bug_queue dropped entries before
  the walk-loop diag) — diagnostic now emitted at load time (+fixture).

**Text defects fixed:** cloud HC-numbering residue (line 27 + 2 citations), cloud HC5 exception
list, lazy-bug-batch §1a false "no --probe support" claim, stale 1d.0 anchor,
`--neutralize-sentinel` wired into decision-resume/blocked-resolution/parked-flush (had zero
consumers), swapped Differences-table row, cloud description named the wrong script
(bug-state→lazy-state), wrapper flip-step duplication (lazy/lazy-cloud now defer to
`--apply-pseudo`), retro inline-override branch false rationale, retro P4-4 gating made it
unreachable, lazy-bug routing table missing plan-bug, bad "Step 0" anchor, stale HC5 summary,
NEEDS_RESEARCH owner row, pre-D3 cycle-format rows in cloud Differences table.

**Known accepted follow-ups (not fixed, deliberate):** malformed-YAML receipt still `_die`s
(exit 2) instead of diagnostic+treated-missing; lazy-state and bug-state share one persisted
signature file (interleaved feature/bug probes reset the repeat streak — fails safe); bold-marker
verification heuristic has a latent false-positive window in heading-less docs + stale docstring;
`~~~` tilde fences not fence-tracked; cloud retains hand-synced inline copies of
cycle-base-prompt/loop-block (manual mirror burden); D2's "recorded in the receipt" is
implemented as resolved-sentinel + run-end digest only (not folded into COMPLETED/FIXED.md);
plan-bug dispatch reuses the "Step 4: investigate bug" step label (cosmetic).
