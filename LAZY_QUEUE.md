| # | item | state | tier |
|---|------|-------|------|
| 1 | [lazy-core-package-decomposition](docs/features/lazy-core-package-decomposition/SPEC.md) | Plan | T1 |
| | status: Plan · next: plan · `lazy_core.py` is a 17,686-line single-module monolith with 169 commits since 2026-05-01 — the hottest file in the repo — so every intervention, however local, canaries against one file, and the PreToolUse hooks (`lazy_guard.py`/`lazy_inject.py`) pay a full-module import (~107 ms warm, ~705 ms cold) on every fire. | | |
| 2 | [shared-hook-lib](docs/features/shared-hook-lib/SPEC.md) | Research | T2 |
| | status: Research · next: research · Extract the ~470 duplicated scaffolding lines (~20% of the 2,411-line `user/hooks/` plane) into a shared, fail-open-guarded pair — `hook-prelude.sh` (sourced bash: python resolution, SCRIPT_DIR derivation, no-python fallback breadcrumb) and `hook_lib.py` (allow/deny emitters, `_append_hook_event`, `_breadcrumb`, the shared `_ENV_PREFIX`/`_CMD_START` anchor regexes) — then migrate the seven python-bearing hooks one at a time, re-running the full 157-test `test_hooks.py` suite after each. | | |
| 3 | [claude-config-ci](docs/features/claude-config-ci/SPEC.md) | ⬡ Needs-input | T3 |
| | status: Needs-input · next: answer needs-input · The harness ships ~18 pytest suites, `lint-skills.py`, the parity audit, the doc-drift linter, a skill-projection check, and a Pester/PSScriptAnalyzer PowerShell family — but no `.github/workflows/`, so those integrity gates only run when someone remembers to run them locally. | | |
| 4 | [native-android-pipeline-steering](docs/features/native-android-pipeline-steering/SPEC.md) | Research | T3 |
| | status: Research · next: research · A real mobile client on the `mobile-queue-control` foundation: browse every lazy-enabled repo's queues, drill into SPECs and halt sentinels, and — the point — **write back** from the phone: answer `NEEDS_INPUT.md` decisions, resolve `BLOCKED.md` halts, and reorder/enqueue the queue. | | |

| | status: Blocked · phase 0/5 · next: resolve blocker · A crashed or killed build leaves orphaned compiler/test child processes and a truncated 0-byte output artifact behind. | | | |
| 3 | [build-queue-copy-lock-stale-dll-false-success](docs/bugs/build-queue-copy-lock-stale-dll-false-success/SPEC.md) | ⛔ Blocked | — | 2026-07-01 |
| | status: Blocked · phase 1/4 · next: resolve blocker · An MSB3027 copy-lock failure (obj/ rebuilt fresh, copy to bin/Debug blocked by a leftover locker) makes MSBuild log "Build FAILED" while still exiting 0. | | | |
| 4 | [build-queue-timeout-kill-reaps-detached-runner](docs/bugs/build-queue-timeout-kill-reaps-detached-runner/SPEC.md) | Plan | — | 2026-07-10 |
| | status: Plan · next: plan · A foreground `build-queue.ps1` call that hits its Bash-tool timeout is tree-killed (exit 143), and the kill takes the supposedly-detached runner with it. | | | |
