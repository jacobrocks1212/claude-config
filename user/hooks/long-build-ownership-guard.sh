# long-build-ownership-guard.sh — PreToolUse(Bash) hook
# (long-build-and-runtime-ownership, Phase 3 / WU-1; M5 Prevent / LD4).
#
# THE M5-PREVENT REQUEST-TIME GUARD. A long build (`tauri build`,
# `cargo build --release`, `npm run build`) backgrounded from inside a dispatched
# cycle subagent DIES when that subagent's turn ends — its process tree is torn
# down with the turn, leaving no artifact and no error. This guard redirects
# exactly those long-build signatures to ORCHESTRATOR ownership so the build runs
# under controller supervision and survives a subagent tear by construction. It
# is the long-build analog of the existing lazy-cycle-containment deny-set, and a
# sibling of block-noncanonical-blocker-write.sh in the fail-OPEN guard family.
#
# RULE: deny a Bash command that contains an EXACT long-build binary invocation
# ANYWHERE in it (not only at the start), so a build chained behind a leading
# command — `cd "..." && cargo build --release`, a pipeline, a `;`-chain — is
# still caught:
#   * `tauri build`
#   * `cargo build --release`
#   * `npm run build`
# On match → DENY with a corrective reason naming the orchestrator-takeover
# signature LONG-BUILD-OWNERSHIP-TAKEOVER, so the orchestrator can deterministically
# recognize the redirect and re-launch the build itself (Bash run_in_background
# from the main session). The matcher is scoped to exact long-build binary
# invocations to keep the false-positive rate near zero — it NEVER redirects
# `ls` / `cat` / `npm run lint` / `cargo check --release` (the fast pre-build
# check the long-build rule recommends) / `npm run build:docs`. It is preceded by
# a word boundary so a long-build token glued onto a longer word does not match,
# but it WILL match a real invocation that follows a `cd ... &&`.
#
# NOTE on "fail-open block": SPEC §M5 prose says the guard "fail-open blocks
# (exit 2)". In Claude Code a PreToolUse blocks via the JSON
# `permissionDecision: deny` — a non-zero exit is a HARD error, not a soft block.
# So the BLOCK is expressed as a `deny` JSON whose reason names the takeover
# signature; that IS the "fail-open block" in this hook framework, matching every
# sibling guard.
#
# FAIL-OPEN: any parse/match error (malformed JSON, missing python, unexpected
# payload shape) ALLOWS the command — a broken hook must never block legitimate
# work. The contract is fail-OPEN-via-empty-output (exit 0, no decision = allow).
# A best-effort breadcrumb is written to the state dir on an internal error,
# mirroring the sibling guards.
#
# Python resolution: python3 preferred (WSL / Linux), falling back to python
# (Windows git-bash where python3 may not be on PATH).

if command -v python3 >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  PYTHON=python3
elif command -v python >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  PYTHON=python
else
  # No python at all → fail open (exit 0, no output).
  exit 0

# All deny/allow logic lives in this inline Python. It reads the PreToolUse JSON
# from stdin and emits an allow/deny hookSpecificOutput block (or nothing for a
# fast allow). It NEVER exits non-zero on an internal error.
#
# The Python body is passed via `-c` (NOT a heredoc): a heredoc would BIND the
# python process's stdin to the script body, swallowing the PreToolUse JSON
# piped into this hook. With `-c`, the hook's real stdin (the payload) flows
# straight through to python's sys.stdin.

# a build chained behind a leading command (`cd "..." && cargo build --release`,
# pipelines, `;`-chains) while still NOT matching a long-build token buried inside
# an argument string (e.g. `echo tauri build` — `build` there follows `echo`, not
# a command separator). `npm run build` is matched as a whole token followed by
# end-of-string or whitespace, so `npm run build:docs` / `npm run build-foo` do
